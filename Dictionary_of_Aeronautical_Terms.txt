abradable strip (gas turbine engine component). A strip of material in the
compressor housing of some axial-flow gas turbine engines. The tip of the
compressor blade touches the abradable strip and actually wears, or abrades, a
groove in it. This groove ensures that the blade operates with the minimum
amount of tip clearance.
abradable tip (compressor blade tip). The tip of some axial-flow compressor
blades made in such a way that it will abrade, or wear away, when it contacts the
compressor housing. The abradable tip wears away to allow the engine to have a
minimum amount of tip clearance between the blade and the housing.

humidity of the air is 100 grams per cubic meter.

absolute instability (meteorology). The state of a layer of air within the
atmosphere in which the vertical distribution of temperature is such that a parcel
of air, if given an upward or downward push, will move away from its initial
level without further outside force being applied.
absolute pressure. Pressure measured relative to zero pressure, or a vacuum.

change their rate of flow and periodically reverse their direction.
ACARS (aircraft communication addressing and reporting system). A two-way
communication link between an airliner in flight and the airline’s main ground

facilities. Replies from the ground may be printed out so the appropriate flight
crewmember can have a hard copy of the response.
ACC (active clearance control). A system for controlling the clearance between
tips of the compressor or turbine blades and the case of high-performance
turbofan engines.
When the engine is operating at maximum power, the blade tip clearance
should be minimum, and the ACC system sprays cool fan-discharge air over the
outside of the engine case. This cool air causes the case to shrink enough to
decrease the tip clearance. For flight conditions not requiring such close
clearance, the cooling air is turned off, and the case expands to its normal
dimensions. Control of the ACC system is done by the FADEC, or FullAuthority Digital Electronic Control.

conditions used in an accelerated-life test are much more severe than will ever
be encountered in normal operation.
accelerate-go distance. For multi-engine flying, the distance required to
accelerate to V1 with all engines at takeoff power, experience an engine failure

otherwise occur between the time the engine stops operating on the idle metering
system and the time there is enough air flowing through the carburetor for it to
supply fuel through the main metering system.

is increased by a force during each second it is acted upon by that force.
Acceleration is normally expressed in terms of feet per second, per second
(fps2).
acceleration caused by gravity. The acceleration of a freely falling body caused
by the pull of gravity. Acceleration caused by gravity is expressed as the rate of
increase of velocity over a given unit of time. This rate, in a vacuum, near sea
level at a location of 40° north latitude is 32.2 feet, or 9.8 meters, per second, per
second. This acceleration decreases with an increase in altitude until it becomes
zero outside of the earth’s gravitational field.

check of a gas turbine engine in which the time required for the engine to
accelerate from idle RPM to its rated-power RPM is compared with the time
specified for this acceleration by the engine manufacturer.
acceleration control unit. See ACU.
acceleration error (magnetic compass error). An error in the indication of a
magnetic compass that shows up when the aircraft accelerates or decelerates
while flying on an easterly or westerly heading.
The float in an aircraft magnetic compass is unbalanced to compensate for the
downward pull of the vertical component of the earth’s magnetic field (dip
error), and the inertia caused by a change in speed acts on this unbalanced
condition.
When the aircraft accelerates on an easterly or westerly heading, the compass
indicates that the aircraft is turning to the north, and when it decelerates on either
of these headings, the compass indicates that the aircraft is turning to the south.
acceleration switch. A switch in a piece of airborne electronic equipment
actuated by an abnormal acceleration. Emergency Locator Transmitters (ELTs)
have an acceleration switch that causes them to begin transmitting if the aircraft
crashes and subjects the ELT to an abnormally high longitudinal acceleration.
Acceleration switches are also called inertia switches.

discharge nozzle of some float-type carburetors. The acceleration well fills with
fuel when the engine is idling, and when the throttle is suddenly opened, this
additional fuel discharges into the engine through the main discharge nozzle.
accelerator (plastic resin component). A substance added to a catalyzed resin to
shorten the time needed for the resin to cure.
accelerator system (carburetor system).A system in an aircraft carburetor used to
supply additional fuel to the engine when the throttle is suddenly opened. If an
acceleration system were not used, the engine would get a momentarily lean
mixture until enough air is pulled through the carburetor to meter the correct
amount of fuel into the cylinders.
accelerator winding (voltage regulator component). A series winding on the
voltage regulator coil in a vibrator-type generator control unit.
Current flowing through the accelerator winding produces a magnetic field
which helps hold the points tightly closed against the force of a spring. As soon

as the points begin to open, this field collapses, and the spring snaps the points
open quickly.
accelerometer. A sensitive instrument that measures the amount of force exerted
on an object because of its acceleration. Accelerometers are calibrated in G-units
(Gravity units). One G-unit is a force equal to the weight of the object.

particular repair or alteration, and it may or may not be approved, depending
upon its applicability to the specific job.
acceptable risk (risk assessment, aeronautical decision making). A result of risk
assessment, when a pilot determines that a certain level of risk or hazard is
manageable and acceptable for a certain flight. As the first task of system safety,
all possible hazards or risks are identified within practical limitations; then those
risks are assessed as to their manageability in flight, or whether they can be
reduced through some other prior action. The resultant level of risk is then
subject to a decision as to whether or not to expose oneself to that level of risk;
this decision is the pilot’s responsibility and affects the “go or no-go” of each
flight. See also unacceptable risk, residual risk.
acceptance test. A test made by a person who buys equipment to be sure the
equipment is exactly as specified in the purchase contract. All large and
expensive aircraft are given extensive acceptance tests before the customer

accident is usually thought to be an unfortunate situation or event.
accumulated error. The sum of all the errors occurring in the operation of a
system or in the manufacture of a part. If the errors are in opposite directions,
they cancel, but if they are in the same direction, the accumulated error is greater
than any of the individual errors.
accumulator (British terminology). An electrical storage battery.
accumulator (electronic computer). A device in a digital computer that stores a
number and, upon the receipt of a second number, adds the two and stores the
sum.
accumulator (hydraulic system component). A component in a hydraulic system
that allows a noncompressible fluid, such as oil, to be stored under pressure. An
accumulator has two compartments separated by a flexible or movable partition
such as a diaphragm, bladder, or piston. One compartment contains compressed
air or nitrogen, and the other is connected into the source of hydraulic pressure.
When oil is pumped into the accumulator, the partition moves over and
increases the pressure of the air. This air pushing against the partition holds
pressure on the oil.
An accumulator in an aircraft hydraulic system acts as a shock absorber and
provides a source of additional hydraulic power when heavy demands are placed
on the system.
accumulator air preload (precharge). The charge of compressed air or nitrogen in
one side of an accumulator. The air preload is normally about one third of the
system hydraulic pressure. When fluid is pumped into the oil side of the
accumulator, the air is further compressed, and the air pressure and the fluid
pressure become the same.
If the air preload pressure is too low, there will be almost no time between the
regulator reaching its kick-in and kick-out pressures, and the system will cycle
far more frequently than it should.
If there is no air pressure gage on the accumulator, the amount of air preload
may be found by watching the hydraulic system pressure gage as the pressure is

slowly bled off the system. The pressure will drop slowly, until a point is
reached at which it drops suddenly. This point is the air preload pressure.
accuracy. A measure of the amount of error, or difference between an actual
value and its indicated value. Accuracy is usually expressed in terms of
percentage of the full range of measurement.
For example, if voltage is measured on a voltmeter having a full-scale range of
ten volts, and the meter has an accuracy of plus or minus two percent of its fullscale reading, the voltage indication will be accurate to within 2% of ten volts, or
it will be accurate within plus or minus 0.2 volt.

being used. Most regulators have two pressure gages, one to indicate the
pressure of the gas in the cylinder and the other to indicate the pressure being
delivered to the torch.
AC flared tube fittings. A series of flare-type fittings used in some of the older
aircraft hydraulic systems. AC fittings have a 35° flare cone, and they may be
distinguished from a similar appearing AN fitting by the threads on an AC fitting
extending all the way to the flare cone, while there is a slight shoulder between
the cone and the first thread of an AN fitting.

the previous aircraft plus the arrival aircraft interval (AAI), whichever is later.
ACLT will not be updated in response to the aircraft’s progress.

temperature of a substance (such as air) that is undergoing a transformation in
which no heat is exchanged with its environment.
adiabatic change. A physical change taking place within a material in which heat
energy is neither added to the material nor taken from it. For example, if a
container of gas is compressed, with no heat energy added to it and none taken
from it, the gas will become hotter—its temperature will rise. This is an
adiabatic change.

adiabatic cooling. The process of cooling the air through expansion. For
example, as air moves up a slope it expands with the reduction of atmospheric
pressure and cools as it expands.

ADI system (antidetonation injection system). A system used with some of the
large reciprocating engines in which a mixture of water and alcohol (methanol)
is sprayed into the engine with the fuel when operating at extremely high power.
The fuel-air mixture is automatically leaned to allow the engine to develop its

turbojet or turbofan engine, used to increase the thrust for takeoff and for special
flight conditions.
Since much of the air passing through a gas turbine engine is used only for
cooling, it still contains a great deal of oxygen. Fuel is sprayed into the hot,
oxygen-rich exhaust in the afterburner, where it burns and produces additional
thrust.
Afterburners, called reheaters in the United Kingdom, use a large amount of
fuel, but the extra thrust they produce makes them efficient for high-performance
aircraft.

is shut down. Afterfiring is normally caused by a malfunctioning manifold drain
valve.

afterfiring (reciprocating engines). A condition that can exist in a reciprocating

of time under specified environmental conditions. Aging may cause the physical
condition of the material either to improve or to deteriorate. Certain aluminum
alloys do not have their full strength when they are first removed from the
quench bath after they have been heat-treated, but they gain this strength after a
few days by the natural process of aging.

air-cycle cooling system. A system for cooling the air in the cabin of a turbinepowered aircraft. Compressor bleed air passes through a primary heat exchanger
and gives up some of its heat. It then passes through a centrifugal compressor
driven by an expansion turbine. The compressor uses energy from the turbine to
raise the temperature and pressure of the partially cooled bleed air. This
additional heat is removed as the air flows through a secondary heat exchanger.
The air then flows through the expansion turbine where it gives up still more of
its energy as the turbine drives the compressor.
When the air, with much of its energy removed, leaves the turbine, it expands
and its pressure and temperature drop further, providing cold air for cooling the
cabin.

light. Pure aluminum is highly resistant to corrosion.
In its natural state, aluminum is soft and weak, but it can be alloyed with such
metals as copper, magnesium, manganese, and zinc to give it strength.
aluminum alloy. Aluminum to which has been added one or more other chemical
elements. These alloying elements increase the hardness, toughness, durability,
or resistance to fatigue of the aluminum.

ammeter between a source of electrical energy and an electrical load to allow the
meter to read a flow of current which exceeds the limit of the instrument.
Most of the current in the circuit flows through the shunt and produces a
voltage drop. The ammeter, acting as a millivoltmeter, measures the voltage drop
across the shunt and indicates, on a special scale, the amount of current flowing
through the circuit.

ammonia. A pungent, invisible gas made up of one atom of nitrogen and three
atoms of hydrogen (NH3). Ammonia becomes a liquid at −28°F and freezes at
−107.6°F.
Ammonia is used to case harden steel by the nitriding process. In this process,
the ammonia combines with aluminum, which has been alloyed with the steel, to
form aluminum nitride. Aluminum nitride gives the steel a very hard surface.
amorphous. Without shape (“a” means without, and “morphous” means shape)
or without a definite character or nature. Clay is a form of amorphous soil, but
sand, which is made of crystals, is not amorphous. The crystals have a definite
shape.

as it changes. For example, the position of the hands of a clock keeps a fixed
relationship with time. It is because of this relationship that we can tell the time
of day by knowing the positions of the clock hands. The position of the clock
hands is an analog of time.
analog computer. An electronic computer which operates by converting different
levels of voltage or current into numerical values in the decimal number system.
One level of voltage (or current) represents the number one, another level
represents two, and so on. Adding or subtracting the voltages (or currents) which
are analogs of the numbers produces a voltage (or current) which is the electrical
equivalent of the sum or the difference of the numbers. There are also
mechanical analog computers that combine mechanical analogs of numbers to
solve mathematical problems.

Output values vary in direct relationship to changes of input values.
analog indicator. An indicator that shows the value of the parameter being
measured by the amount a pointer moves across a numerical scale.

into a digital form. Analog-to-digital conversion is done with an analog-todigital (A-to-D) converter, which changes the varying values of an analog signal
into combinations of conditions that are either on or off. The digital values can
be processed in a digital computer.
anchor. A heavy hook connected to a seaplane by a line or cable, intended to dig
into the bottom of the lake or riverbed and keep the seaplane from drifting.

radar absorbing materials. Anechoic rooms are used for testing radar
components in an environment in which there are no echoes.
anemometer. An instrument used to measure the velocity of moving air. A cuptype anemometer uses a series of hemispherical metal cups mounted on arms on
a shaft. The air blows the cups and rotates the shaft. A counter measures the
number of revolutions the shaft makes in a given period of time and converts this
into wind speed.
A fan-type anemometer uses a small, multibladed propeller, turned by the air
moving through it. The faster the air flows, the faster the fan turns.
The dial on the anemometer may be marked in feet per second, meters per
second, kilometers per hour, miles per hour, or knots.
aneroid. The sensitive component in an altimeter or barometer that measures the
absolute pressure of the air. An aneroid is a sealed, flat capsule made of thin
disks of corrugated metal soldered together and evacuated by pumping all of the
air out of it.
Evacuating the aneroid allows it to expand or collapse as the air pressure on the
outside changes. The pressure of the air can be found by measuring the amount
the aneroid expands or collapses.

and the direction of the air that strikes the airfoil.

angle of attack (gas turbine engine compressor). The acute angle formed
between the chord line of the compressor blades and the direction the air strikes
the blades. This angle of attack is affected by both the velocity of the air flowing
through the compressor and the RPM of the compressor.
If the RPM of the compressor is too high for the velocity of the air flowing
through the engine, the angle of attack will be excessively high, and the
compressor blades can stall.

blade and the relative wind. The angle of attack is affected by both the engine
RPM and the forward speed of the aircraft.

of a circle.
One radian is the amount of separation between two lines that is equal to 360°
÷ 2π, or 57.3°.
One grad is the amount of separation between two lines that is equal to 1 ⁄400 of
a circle, or 1 ⁄100 of a right angle.

softened so it loses some of its hardness and brittleness. Steel is annealed by
heating it to a specified temperature and allowing it to cool very slowly, in an
oven. Copper is annealed by heating it red-hot and quenching it in water.

and powerplant required for FAA-certificated aircraft operating under 14 CFR
Part 91 (General Operating and Flight Rules) that are not on one of the
authorized special inspection programs.
An annual inspection must be conducted every 12 calendar months by an
Aviation Maintenance Technician who holds an Aircraft rating with an
Inspection Authorization. The scope of an annual inspection is the same as that
of a 100-hour inspection.
annual rings. The rings that appear in the end of a log cut from a tree. The
number of annual rings per inch gives an indication of the strength of the wood.
The more rings there are and the closer they are together, the stronger the wood.
The alternate light and dark rings are caused by the difference in the growth
rate of the tree. A tree grows fast in the spring and summer, producing the lightcolored, less dense rings. The slower growth during the fall and winter produces
the dark-colored, denser rings.
annular combustor (gas turbine engine component). A single-piece combustor
for a gas turbine engine made in the shape of a ring or a cylinder. Fuel is sprayed
from nozzles mounted around a fuel manifold into the inner liner of the

annular orifice. A ring-shaped orifice, normally one that surrounds another
orifice.

annulus. A ring or groove cut around the outside of a circular body or shaft. An
annulus gets its name from its resemblance to the circular shape of the annual
rings (the growth rings) which form in the trunk of a tree.
annunciator panel. A panel of warning lights in plain view of the pilot of an
airplane or the operator of other types of equipment. The lights are identified by
the name of the system they represent and are usually covered with a colored
lens to show the meaning of the condition they announce. Red lights are used to
indicate a dangerous condition, amber lights show that some system is armed, or
active, and green lights show that a condition is safe.
By having all the lights together in an annunciator panel, the pilot or operator
can determine the overall operating condition of the equipment at a glance.
anode. The electrode in a vacuum tube or semiconductor diode to which the
electrons travel after they leave the cathode. The anode in a vacuum tube is
called the plate.

The anode of a semiconductor diode is the end made of P-type material. It is
not marked—the cathode has the mark. In the diode symbol, the anode is shown
by the arrowhead.
anode current. Current that flows in the anode of an electrical device. In an
electron tube, anode current is commonly called plate current.
anode of a chemical cell. The area in a chemical cell from which electrons have
migrated. When electrons leave an area, it becomes less negative, or takes on a
positive charge. Electrons then try to move from an area having an excess of
electrons, the cathode of the cell, to this anodic area.
anodic area. An area inside a piece of metal that has lost some of its electrons.
This leaves a net positive charge which attracts negative ions from the
electrolyte. Positive metallic ions and negative ions from the electrolyte unite to
form the salts of corrosion.
anodizing. A method of preventing corrosion of aluminum alloy parts. A hard
oxide film is formed on the surface of the metal by an electrolytic process. This

was one of the first practical radio navigational aids.
Two antennas, arranged so they are at approximately right angles to each other,
radiate low-frequency signals in the form of two figure eights. One antenna
transmits the Morse code letter A (. –), and the other transmits the letter N (– .).

A pilot flying an airplane in the area where the two signals overlap hears a
solid tone. As the airplane moves to one side or the other, the letter A or N
predominates, and this indicates to the pilot the side to which he has moved. The
area of overlapping signals, usually about three degrees wide, is called the
“beam.”
antenna. A conductor used with a radio transmitter or receiver to radiate or
receive electromagnetic energy.
antenna coupler (radio equipment). A special transformer used to connect an
antenna to a radio receiver or transmitter. The antenna coupler allows the
maximum amount of energy to be transferred between the antenna and the

microwave antenna that focuses the radiated energy in much the same way a
glass lens focuses light waves.
antenna matching (radio installation). The process of matching the impedance of
a radio antenna with the impedance of the transmission line carrying the signal
from the transmitter to the antenna.
For the maximum amount of energy to be transferred, the impedance of the
transmission line must be the same as the impedance of the antenna. Antenna
matching is done by the selection of proper components in the antenna system.
antenna wire (aircraft radio antenna). A type of wire having a low electrical
resistance and a high tensile strength. Copperweld, a form of copper-plated steel
wire, is often used for antennas.
antiblush thinner (aircraft finishing material). A slow-drying thinner used with
certain types of lacquer or dope to slow the evaporation of the solvents. When
the solvents evaporate too rapidly, the evaporation drops the temperature of the
surrounding air enough to cause moisture to condense out of the air. This
moisture causes the dope or lacquer to blush.
anticathode (X-ray tube component). The electrode, or target, in an X-ray tube

which, when struck by the stream of electrons from the cathode, emits X-rays.
anticollision light. A flashing light on the vertical fin or belly of an aircraft.

air has a closed circulation. In the northern hemisphere, the circulation of air out
of a high-pressure area is clockwise (anticyclonic). In the southern hemisphere,
the circulation out of a high is counterclockwise (cyclonic). At the equator, the
circulation is indefinite; it can go either way.

glycol, a form of alcohol, is an antifreeze agent that is normally used as the
coolant in liquid-cooled reciprocating engines.
antifriction bearing. Any bearing that supports a rotating shaft with a rolling
contact, rather than a sliding contact. Ball bearings, roller bearings, and needle
bearings are all antifriction bearings. Plain bearings and bushings which support
rotating shafts with a sliding contact between the bearing and the shaft are called
friction-type bearings.
antiglare paint. A black or dark paint that dries to a dull or, nonspecular, finish.
Antiglare paint is applied to a surface, such as the deck in front of the windshield
of an aircraft, to prevent glare interfering with the flight crew’s visibility.
anti-icing. The prevention of the formation of ice on a surface. Ice may be
prevented by the use of heat or by covering the surface with a chemical which
prevents water adhering to the surface. Anti-icing should not be confused with
deicing, which is the removal of ice after it has formed on the surface.

anti-icing additive (turbine engine fuel). A chemical added to turbine-engine fuel
used in some aircraft. This additive mixes with water that condenses from the
fuel and lowers its freezing temperature so it will not freeze and block the fuel
filters. It also acts as a biocidal agent and prevents the formation of microbial
contamination in the tanks.
anti-icing fluid. A fluid, usually made of some form of alcohol and glycerine,
that is sprayed on an aircraft to keep ice from forming on the surfaces. Anti-icing
fluid is also carried in the aircraft and is sprayed over the windshield, along the
propeller blades, and into the carburetor throat in flight.
anti-icing system (airframe system). A system that prevents the formation of ice
on an aircraft structure.
anti-icing system (gas turbine engine system). A system in a gas turbine engine
in which hot compressor bleed air is routed through the engine air inlet system to
warm it so ice will not form on it.
antiknock rating (antidetonation characteristics). The rating of a reciprocating
engine fuel that refers to the ability of the fuel to resist detonation. The
antiknock rating is generally called the octane rating of the fuel because isooctane is used as the reference fuel for the rating.
antileak check valve (reciprocating engine lubrication system component). A
check valve used in the oil tank of some aircraft reciprocating engines equipped
with dry-sump lubrication systems.
Antileak check valves hold the oil in the tank against the pull of gravity, but as
soon as the oil pump puts a low pressure on the check valve, it opens and allows
oil to flow from the tank into the engine.
antilogarithm. The number from which a logarithm is derived. The symbol for
antilogrithm is log–1.
antimissile missile. A missile launched from the surface or from an aircraft to
locate and destroy another missile.
antimony. A hard, brittle, lustrous, silvery-white metallic chemical element.
Antimony’s symbol is Sb, its atomic number is 51, and its atomic weight is
121.75. Antimony expands as it changes from its molten state into a solid state,
and because of this, it is an important alloying element with lead for type metal
and for making lead-acid storage batteries.

antipropeller end (aircraft engine). The end of an aircraft engine opposite the end
to which the propeller is attached. Front or back is not always a good way to
identify the ends of an aircraft engine, because the engine may be used with the
propeller either in front or in back. To identify the ends of an engine correctly,
the terms propeller end and antipropeller end are used. The antipropeller end is
often called the accessory end.
antiseize compound. A lubricant used on threads to prevent their locking
together. Antiseize compound is specially needed on spark plugs in reciprocating
engines and on threaded fasteners in the hot section of gas turbine engines.
antiservo tab. A tab installed on the trailing edge of a stabilator. The tab
automatically moves in the same direction as the stabilator to produce a
stabilizing aerodynamic force that tries to bring the surface back to a streamline
position. An antiservo tab is also called an antibalance tab.

antiskid brake system. An electrohydraulic control in an airplane’s power brake
system that prevents the wheels skidding on wet or icy runways.
A wheel-speed sensor monitors the deceleration rate of every main landing
gear wheel. If any wheel decelerates too rapidly, indicating an impending skid,
pressure to that brake is released and the wheel stops decelerating. Pressure is
then reapplied at a slightly lower value.
antitear strips. Strips of aircraft fabric laid under the reinforcing tape before the
fabric is stitched to an aircraft wing.
antitorque pedals (helicopter controls). Foot pedals used by the pilot to control
the pitch of the antitorque rotor on the tail of a single-rotor helicopter.
Controlling the pitch of the antitorque rotor allows the pilot to rotate the
helicopter about its vertical axis.

antitorque rotor. See tail rotor.
anvil. A hard-faced block used as a surface on which parts may be hammered or
shaped.
anvil cloud (meteorology). The popular term given to the top portion of a
cumulonimbus cloud because of its anvil shape.
anxiety. Mental discomfort that arises from the fear of anything, real or
imagined. Anxiety can have a potent effect on actions and the ability to learn
from perceptions.
aperiodic compass. A form of aircraft magnetic compass that has damping vanes
on the float. These vanes keep the compass from oscillating when flying in
rough air or when the aircraft is turned to a new heading.
aperiodic damping. Damping which prevents an object overswinging, or moving
past its at-rest position. If a pendulum does not have aperiodic damping, when it
is disturbed from its at-rest position, it will move back toward this position but
will overshoot and oscillate back and forth, with each oscillation smaller than the
swing before it.
An aperiodically damped pendulum will not swing back and forth, but will stop
just as it reaches its at-rest position. Aperiodic damping is also called dead-beat
damping.

which is the product of the total current and the source voltage. Apparent power,
measured in volt-amps, must be multiplied by the power factor to get true power
in watts.
apparent weight. The weight of an object when it is immersed in a liquid. It is

the weight of the object, less the weight of the liquid it displaces, and is the
difference between the force of gravity acting downward on the object and the
buoyant force produced by the liquid acting upward.
appliance. Any device used in the operation of an aircraft that is not a part of the
airframe, engine, or propeller. Pumps, actuators, generators, instruments, and
radio receivers and transmitters are all examples of appliances.
14 CFR Part 1: “Any instrument, mechanism, equipment, part, apparatus,
appurtenance, or accessory, including communications equipment that is used or
intended to be used in operating or controlling an aircraft in flight, is installed in
or attached to the aircraft, and is not part of an airframe, engine, or propeller.”

open tube whose inside is specially shaped to produce thrust when fuel is burned
in it.
When the athodyd moves through the air at a high speed, the air in its front end
is compressed. Fuel is added to this compressed air and burned, and the burning
fuel heats the air and expands it. This expansion accelerates the air to the rear
and produces thrust.

on the initial call-up from each pilot.
atmosphere. The layer of gases surrounding the earth, from the surface upward
to a height of about 22 miles. The atmosphere consists of a mixture of nitrogen,

0.07651 pound per cubic foot, and it becomes lighter, or less dense, as its height
above the earth increases.

The temperature of the atmosphere drops as its altitude increases, to about

automatic dependent surveillance (ADS). A surveillance method that, rather than
relying on radar coverage, relies instead on data-link reports from an aircraft’s
avionics and position-fixing systems, which occur automatically whenever
specific events occur, or specific time intervals are reached. ADS is “dependent”
on the aircraft’s data-link reports and does not require an independent
surveillance source (such as a radar antenna) to operate; therefore it can provide

accurate surveillance reports in remote and oceanic areas that for many reasons
would never be inside radar coverage. The ADS reports, including aircraft
identification, four dimensional position, and additional data as appropriate, are
converted by data-link equipped ground stations into an ADS track. This is then
presented on the controller’s display to provide enhanced situational awareness
and the potential for reduced separation standards. There are two current
implementations of ADS; see automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast
(ADS-B) and automatic dependent surveillance-contract (ADS-C).
automatic dependent surveillance–broadcast (ADS-B). An ADS implementation
method that operates in a broadcast mode, in which an aircraft periodically
broadcasts its GPS-derived positional (and other, such as velocity) information
on a regular basis into the ether via data-link, which is received by a groundbased transmitter/receiver (transceiver) for processing and display at an ATC
facility to identify aircraft location. The ADS-B transmitter in the aircraft
broadcasts the position of the airplane to any appropriately-equipped station,
including other aircraft and ground stations. The ADS-B system can also accept
broadcasts with information on other traffic locations and weather. The reporting
rate for ADS-B is significantly higher than ADS-C; therefore the FAA plans to
use ADS-B to eventually eliminate traditional rotating radar. See also automatic
dependent surveillance-contract (ADS-C), and ADS-B In, ADS-B Out.
automatic dependent surveillance–contract (ADS-C). An ADS implementation
method established by the ground station via data-link, following a log-on with
an aircraft that establishes “contracts” with the aircraft’s avionics. Once
established, these contracts automatically provide reports whenever specific
events occur, or specific time intervals are reached, to the ground-based
transmitter/receiver that transmits them for processing and display at an ATC
facility.
Its main difference from ADS-B is that ADS-C relies on contracts, or prior
agreements that were established between the ground system and the aircraft’s
avionics. Reports from the aircraft are generated in accordance with the contract
agreement set up prior to the provision of ADS-C services. The contract
specifies under what conditions ADS-C reports would be initiated, and what data
is requested for the reports; the aircraft then automatically complies to supply the
data requested when it is technically possible to do so. ADS-C reporting is
controlled by the ground station in all situations other than emergency contracts.

edges are sealed to form a bag over the part. The entire assembly is then placed
in an autoclave, and the air pressure is increased to force the layers of material
tightly together. If an autoclave is not used, a vacuum pump can be attached to
the inside of the bag and the air pumped out. The atmospheric pressure pressing
on the outside of the bag supplies the needed force.

leading edge of some ailerons that produces a force which assists the pilot in
holding them deflected.
The balance panel divides a chamber ahead of the aileron in such a way that
when the aileron is deflected downward, for example, air flowing over its top
surface produces a low pressure that acts on the balance panel and causes it to
apply an upward force to the leading edge as long as it is deflected.

rotate it are balanced. These forces are equal in amount, but they act on the
opposite sides of the balance point.

surface of an airplane. The tab is automatically actuated in such a way it moves
in the direction opposite to the direction the control surface on which it is
mounted moves. Air flowing over the balance tab produces a force on the control
surface that reduces the amount of force needed by the pilot to move the surface.
balance to unbalance transformer. See balun.

circuits. The output signals from these two circuits are equal in amplitude but
opposite in phase. A balanced amplifier is also called a push-pull amplifier.
balanced bridge (electrical measuring circuit). An electrical measuring circuit
that uses three known resistances (R1, R2, and R3) and one unknown resistance
(R4). The bridge is balanced (R1 : R2 = R3 : R4) when no current flows through
the indicator.

balanced control surface (airplane control). A movable primary control surface
on an airplane designed in such a way that aerodynamic forces help the pilot
move the surface.
A portion of the surface, called the balance area, extends ahead of the hinge

inner and outer races and one or more sets of balls. In bearings designed for
disassembly, a removable sheet metal retainer holds the balls in place.
ball check valve (fluid power system component). A type of flow control valve
used in a fluid power system to allow fluid to flow in one direction but not in the
other.
A ball check valve contains a spring-loaded ball that seats in one side of the
valve. The ball is forced tightly against its seat by fluid entering the valve from
the end containing the spring, and the fluid cannot flow through the valve.
Pressure on the side of the valve containing the ball forces the ball off its seat
and fluid flows through the valve. Fluid flowing through the valve is opposed
only by the force of the spring.

increase the pitch attitude and angle of attack too rapidly, causing the descent to
stop and the plane to start climbing.
balsa wood. A soft, strong, lightweight wood from the tropical American balsa
tree. Balsa wood is used in aircraft structure as the core for sandwich-type
material. Planks of balsa are cut across the grain and are bonded (glued) between

attenuates, a band of frequencies, while passing with little loss all frequencies on
either side of this band.
band saw (power tool). A form of power saw used to cut wood, plastics, or
metal. The band saw blade is a narrow strip of steel with teeth along one edge.
The ends of the blade are welded together to form a continuous loop, and the
loop passes over two large wheels, one above and the other below the saw table.
One of the wheels is driven by an electric motor, and its speed is controllable to
allow the operator to match the speed of the blade to the type and thickness of
material being cut. For cutting the inside of a hole, many band saws have an
attachment that allows the saw blade to be cut in two and an end put through a
hole in the work. The ends are then welded back together and the weld ground
smooth.
bandwidth (electrical circuit characteristic). The difference between the highest

and the lowest frequencies in a band of frequencies.
bank (airplane flight maneuver). To rotate an airplane about its longitudinal axis,
or tilt its wings, by using the ailerons. An airplane is turned by banking it.
The lift produced by the wings of an airplane always acts perpendicular to the
lateral axis of the airplane. When the airplane is banked, the lift tilts, and its
horizontal component pulls the nose of the airplane around in a curved flight
path. The rudder of an airplane is used only to start the nose moving in the
correct direction as the airplane begins to turn.
bank attitude. The angle of the lateral axis relative to the horizon.
bank indicator (aircraft flight instrument). A flight instrument used to show the
pilot whether or not the bank angle being used is correct for the rate of turn
being made; it is a curved glass tube partially filled with a clear liquid and
containing a black glass ball. The ball rolls back and forth inside the tube to
show the relationship between the centrifugal force, caused by the rate of turn,
and the force of gravity, determined by the angle of bank. The position of the
ball in the tube shows the pilot whether or not the angle of bank is proper for the
rate of turn.
When the bank angle is correct for the rate of turn, the force of gravity acting
on the ball exactly balances the centrifugal force, and the ball stays in the center
of the tube. If the angle of bank is too steep for the rate of turn, the ball rolls to
the inside of the turn, and if the angle of bank is not steep enough, the ball rolls
to the outside of the turn.
A bank indicator is built into the face of a turn and slip indicator. See turn and
slip indicator.

States were started by barnstormers who leased or bought some farmer’s field
and built it into an airport. Most of the barnstorming was done between the end
of World War I and 1926, at which time the federal government began to require
licenses for airplanes and pilots.

instrument (a type of barometer) that produces a permanent record of the time
and the pressure it is measuring. Barographs are often sealed and are carried
aloft to make a permanent record of the altitude that has been reached by the
aircraft.

specified period of time. For aviation weather observations, the time period is
normally three hours.

the airplane rolls around its longitudinal axis. The term barrel roll has been
replaced in modern usage; the maneuver is now called an aileron roll, or slow
roll.
barrier voltage (semiconductor parameter). The voltage across a forward-biased
PN junction in a semiconductor diode or transistor. When the mobile charges are
drawn away from the junction, ionic charges are left. These ionic charges cause
a voltage, or potential difference, to exist across the junction. The positive
barrier voltage is in the N-material, and the negative barrier voltage is in the Pmaterial. The barrier voltage across the junction in a silicon diode is about 0.7
volt, and approximately 0.3 volt in a germanium diode.

battery eliminator circuit (BEC). Also known as a voltage regulator, an
electronic circuit that accepts the input of the flight battery voltage and outputs a
lower voltage to the components that require it.
battery ignition system. An ignition system similar to that used in most
automobiles. The source of energy is a battery or generator rather than a
magneto. A cam, driven by the engine, opens a set of breaker points to interrupt

is the portion of the structure between adjacent bulkheads, frames, or struts.
bayonet exhaust stack (aircraft reciprocating engine component). The elongated
and flattened end of the exhaust stack used on an aircraft reciprocating engine.
The gases leave the stack through a slot parallel to its length. Bayonet stacks
decrease both exhaust back pressure and noise and prevent cold air from flowing
into the exhaust stack during such maneuvers as slips. This cold air could cause
the valves to warp.

bead thermistor (fire detection system component). A component in a fire
detection system that signals the presence of a fire or overheat condition. Beads
of a thermistor material (a material, such as germanium, whose resistance
changes with its temperature) support a wire that forms part of the fire detection
circuit. The bead-supported wire is enclosed in a metal tube routed through the
area to be protected.
If the tube is heated by a fire, the thermistor material changes from an insulator
into a conductor and completes an electrical circuit between the central wire and
the tube. This completed circuit initiates the fire-warning procedure by turning
on the fire-warning light and sounding the fire-warning bell.

that uses two beam-forming electrodes, or plates, to shape the flow of electrons
so they travel from the cathode to the plate in definite beams. The screen grid is
wound in such a way that its wires are in the shadow cast by the control grid, and
keeping the screen grid out of the path of the electrons helps minimize screen
current. Beam power tubes are power amplifier tubes, rather than voltage
amplifiers.
beam resolution (radar technology). The ability of radar to distinguish between
targets at approximately the same range but along different azimuths.

bearing installed in an airplane wheel. The complete bearing consist of the cup,
which is a shrink-fit in the bearing cavity of the wheel, a bearing cone (the inner
race), and rollers. Grease seals and retainers keep dirt out of the bearing.

bearing friction. Friction that is caused by bearings.
bearing race. The hardened steel surface upon which the balls or rollers of an
antifriction bearing ride.

normally treated in some way to decrease the friction between the surface and
the load being moved.
beat (vibration). A low-frequency sound, or vibration, produced when two
sources of vibration having almost, but not exactly, the same frequency, act on
an object at the same time.
For example, in a multi-engine airplane, if one engine is turning at 1,850 RPM
and the other is turning at 1,880 RPM, the airframe vibrations caused by these
engines will produce a very noticeable beat of 30 cycles per minute. This beat is
caused by the difference in the frequency of the two vibrations.
beat frequency. The frequency of vibration produced when two sources of
vibration act on a common body. The beat frequency is the difference between
the frequencies of the two original vibrations.

operating with reduced power.
best glide speed (best L/D speed). The airspeed that results in the least amount of
altitude loss over a given distance. The aircraft’s manufacturer publishes the best

BFO (beat-frequency oscillator). A variable radio-frequency electronic oscillator
used with communications receivers when receiving unmodulated CW
(continuous wave) signals. The unmodulated CW has a frequency that is too
high to hear, so it is mixed with the output of the BFO. When the BFO is
adjusted so its frequency is nearly the same as that of the CW signal being
received, the two signals beat together and produce an audio-frequency signal
that can be heard. The frequency of this AF is the difference between the
frequency of the unmodulated CW and that produced by the BFO.

H, when the material is first magnetized, and the closed hysteresis loop that
shows the effect of hysteresis, the magnetism that remains in the material.

circuit.
bimetallic hairspring. A flat, spiral-wound spring made of two strips of metal
laid side-by-side and welded together. The two metals have different coefficient

of steel. The disk and blades are an integral unit.
blister (evidence of corrosion). A raised spot on a piece of metal that contains
the salts of corrosion. Corrosion forms under the surface of the metal, and since

its salts have so much more volume than the metal they displace, the surface
layer of metal is pushed out to form the blister.
blizzard (meteorology). Severe weather conditions characterized by low
temperatures and strong winds bearing a great amount of snow, either falling or
picked up from the ground.
block altitude. A block of altitudes assigned by ATC to allow altitude deviations;
for example, “Maintain block altitude 9 to 11 thousand.”
block diagram. A functional diagram of a system in which the units are
represented by blocks that describe the functions of the unit and show its
relationship to the other units of the system. Arrows between the blocks show
the direction of flow of energy or information within the system. Block diagrams
do not show any of the actual components.
“Blocked” (air traffic control communications). The phrase used to indicate that
a radio transmission has been distorted or interrupted due to multiple
simultaneous radio transmissions.
block heater (sheet metalworking tool). An electrical heater embedded in the die
used for hot dimpling sheet metal.

used in the exhaust system of a reciprocating engine.
blower. A mechanical device, such as a fan, used to move a volume of air.
blower (reciprocating engine component). An internal gear-driven supercharger
in an aircraft reciprocating engine. Blowers increase the pressure of the air after
it passes through the carburetor and improve the uniformity of the distribution of
the fuel-air mixture to all the cylinders.
blower section (reciprocating engine crankcase section). The section of an
aircraft reciprocating engine crankcase that houses the internal, gear-driven
supercharger.
blow-in doors. Spring-loaded doors in the inlet duct of some turbojet or turbofan
engine installations that are opened by an air pressure differential when the inlet
air pressure becomes a certain amount lower than that of the ambient air. Air
flowing through the doors adds to the normal inlet air passing through the engine
and helps prevent compressor stall.

surface of a large body of water.
blow molding. A form of plastic molding in which a hollow tube of
thermoplastic material is heated inside a mold. Air pressure is applied to the
inside of the tube, and the soft plastic material is forced out against the walls of
the mold. The outside of the part takes the form of the inside of the mold. The
mold is then opened and the molded part removed. A blow-down turbine is a
velocity-type turbine driven by the exhaust gases from the engine and coupled

through a fluid coupling to the engine crankshaft. Blow-down turbines are also
called power-recovery turbines, or PRTs.
blown boundary layer control (aerodynamics). A method of decreasing
aerodynamic drag on the surface of an airplane wing. The boundary layer is the
layer of air which flows in a random fashion directly over the surface of the
wing.
Blown boundary layer control uses high-velocity air blown through ducts or
jets to energize, or add energy to, the boundary layer. Energizing this air speeds
it up and causes it to flow straight across the wing.
blowout plug. A safety plug on the outside skin of an aircraft fuselage near the
installation of high-pressure oxygen or fire extinguisher agent. If, for any reason,
the pressure of the gas in the cylinders rises to a dangerous level, the blowout
plug will blow out and relieve the pressure. Colored disks in the blowout plugs
identify the system that has been relieved in this manner.
blowtorch. A handheld torch that uses liquid gasoline as a fuel. Air is pumped
into the fuel tank, and the liquid fuel sprays out into the burner where it becomes
a vapor. The air compressed in the tank blows through the flame and intensifies
it.
Gasoline blowtorches have been replaced, to a great extent, by torches using
propane or other liquified petroleum products as their fuel.
bluckets (turbofan engine component). The portions of aft-fan blades that are in
the exhaust of the core engine. Bluckets drive the fan by energy received from
the hot gases leaving the core engine.
blue line (instrument marking). A blue radial line is used on an aircraft
instrument to indicate a special operating condition. A blue line on the airspeed
indicator of a multiengine airplane indicates the best single-engine rate of climb
speed. On a helicopter airspeed indicator, it indicates the maximum safe
autorotation speed.
blueprint. A type of engineering drawing used in the design and manufacture of
aircraft, aircraft engines, and various components. Lines in the drawing appear
white on a dark blue background.
The original drawing is made with black ink on translucent drawing paper or
cloth. This drawing is then used as a negative, and sensitized paper is exposed

through the drawing by exposing it to a high-intensity light. After the exposure,
the print is developed by washing it in water.
Blueprints have been replaced in many engineering departments by prints made
by the Ozalid process, in which the exposed sensitized paper is developed by
exposing it to ammonia fumes.
blush (aircraft finishing system defect). A defect in a lacquer or dope finish
caused by moisture condensing on the surface before the finish dries. If the
humidity of the air is high, the evaporation of the solvents cools the air enough
to cause the moisture to condense. The water condensed from the air mixes with
the lacquer or dope and forms a dull, porous, chalky-looking finish. This is
called blush. A blushed finish is neither attractive nor protective.
BMEP (brake mean effective pressure). The average pressure inside the cylinder
of a reciprocating engine during the power stroke. BMEP, measured in pounds
per square inch, relates to the torque produced by the engine, and can be
calculated when the brake horsepower and RPM of the engine are known.
B-nut. A type of tubing nut used to attach a piece of flared tubing to a threaded
fitting. B-nuts are used with a sleeve slipped over the tubing before the tubing is
flared. The B-nut forces the sleeve tight against the flare, which seals against the
flare cone of the male fitting.

board-foot. A unit of measurement commonly used for lumber. One board-foot
is the amount of lumber in a piece of wood one foot long, one foot wide, and one
inch thick. A board-foot is also used for the dimensions of any piece of board
whose volume is equal to 144 cubic inches.
bob weight (aircraft control system component). A mechanical weight in the
elevator control system of some airplanes. The bob weight is used to apply a
nose-down force on the elevator control system. This force is counteracted by an
aerodynamic force caused by the elevator trim tab. If the aircraft slows down
enough that the aerodynamic force on the trim tab is lost, the bob weight forces
the nose down, and the airplane picks up speed.

bogie landing gear (aircraft landing gear). The landing gear of an aircraft that
uses tandem wheels mounted along the center line of the aircraft fuselage. Some
aircraft having bogie landing gear are supported while parked by outrigger
wheels mounted far out on the wing.
bogus parts. Parts not approved for use in aircraft maintenance. Bogus parts are
normally made to look like legitimate parts. They carry the same part number as
the legitimate part, and are often packaged in boxes that look like the box in
which the original part was sold. When bogus parts are installed in an aircraft,
safety is often compromised.
boiling point. The temperature at which a liquid begins to change into a gas. The
boiling point of a liquid varies with the pressure of the air above it. The boiling
point of water, under standard sea level conditions, is 212°F, or 100°C.
bolt. A threaded fastener which has an enlarged head on one end and threads on
the other. Bolts used in aircraft normally have hexagonal heads, but some highstrength bolts have a round head with a hexagonal-shaped hole. These special
bolts are turned with an Allen wrench. Bolts fasten pieces of material together by
clamping them between the bolt head and a nut screwed onto the bolt threads.
bolt boss. The raised section of a casting where the bolt is passed through.
bomb tester (spark plug tester). A shop tool used to test spark plugs after they
have been cleaned and gapped. After a spark plug has been serviced, it is
screwed into the bomb tester, and about 200-psi air pressure is applied to the
firing end. High voltage is directed into the terminal cavity of the spark plug, and
the electrodes are observed to see the type and amount of spark being produced.
If a spark plug operates properly in a bomb tester, it will almost always work
properly when it is installed in an aircraft engine.
bomber. A military aircraft designed to carry a bomb load over enemy territory
and release it in such a way that it will do the maximum amount of damage.
bond (chemical force). The strong attractive force that holds the atoms together
in a molecule.
bonded structure. Aircraft structure joined together by chemical methods, rather
than mechanical fasteners. Components made of laminated fiberglass,
honeycomb material, and the advanced composite materials are examples of
aircraft bonded structure.

Bonderizing. The registered trade name for a patented process of coating steel
parts with a phosphate film. Bonderizing protects the parts from corrosion.
bonding (electrical). The process of electrically connecting all isolated
components to the aircraft structure. Bonding provides a path for return current
from the components and provides a low-impedance path to ground to minimize
radio interference from static electrical charges collected on the component.
Shock-mounted instrument panels have bonding braids connected across the
shock mounts, so that return current from the instruments can flow into the main
structure and thus return to the alternator or battery.
bonding (structural). A method of joining parts by using chemical adhesives,
rather than any form of mechanical fastener.
bonding agent (structural). An adhesive used to bond together materials used in
aircraft construction.
bonding braid (electrical bonding). A flat copper braid used to electrically
connect isolated components to the aircraft structure to drain off any static
electrical charges that could otherwise build up high enough to cause a spark, or
interfere with electronic equipment.
bonding jumper (electrical systems). A low-resistance wire or metal strap used to
connect a structural component or an electrical component to the basic structure
of an aircraft. Bonding jumpers carry the return current from an electrical
component back to the battery. Small bonding jumpers connect flight control
surfaces to the main structure to carry static electrical charges that build up when
air flows over the surface into the main structure. Bonding prevents sparks that
could cause radio interference.
bond ply (composites). The ply of fabric that comes in contact with the
honeycomb core in a repair.
bond strength. The stress required to rupture a bond formed by an adhesive
between two objects.
bonnet assembly (fire extinguisher). The connector between a high-rate
discharge (HRD) bottle of fire extinguishing agent and the line that carries the
agent to the discharge point. An electrically ignited powder charge blows a
cutter through a frangible disk that seals the bottle and allows the instantaneous
discharge of the agent.

Boolean algebra (mathematics). A system of mathematical logic used to permit
computations to be performed by binary electrical circuits. Gates such as AND,
OR, NAND, NOR, and EXCLUSIVE OR are used to make electrical models of
the Boolean algebraic functions.
boost (manifold pressure). A term for manifold pressure which has been
increased above atmospheric pressure by a supercharger.
boost charge (batteries). A constant-voltage charge given to a partially
discharged storage battery for a short period of time.
boost pump (aircraft fuel system component). An electrically driven centrifugal
pump mounted in the bottom of the fuel tanks in large aircraft.
Boost pumps are used to provide a positive flow of fuel under pressure to the
engine for starting and to serve as an emergency backup in the event the enginedriven pump should fail. They are also used to transfer fuel from one tank to
another and to pump fuel overboard when it is being dumped.
Boost pumps maintain pressure on the fuel in the line to the engine-driven
pump to prevent a vapor lock forming in these lines. Centrifugal boost pumps
have a small agitator propeller on top of the pump impeller. This agitator causes
the vapors in the fuel to be released before the fuel leaves the tank.
boost system (flight controls). A hydraulic system that assists in the movement
of flight controls.
boost venturi. A small, auxiliary venturi whose discharge is located in the throat
of a larger venturi. Boost venturis increase the pressure drop produced by the
main venturi. They are installed in such devices as carburetors and in the large
venturi tubes used to provide the low pressure for some vacuum-operated flight
instruments.
boosted brake (aircraft hydraulic brake). A form of power brake which uses
hydraulic system pressure to help the pilot apply force to the brake master
cylinder. When the brake pedal is depressed, hydraulic system pressure acts on
the piston in the brake master cylinder to apply the brakes. Boosted brakes and
power brakes are not the same. Power brake systems use hydraulic system
pressure in the brake wheel cylinders themselves.
boosted control system (aircraft flight controls). Flight controls of large, highperformance aircraft actuated by hydraulic cylinders. Hydraulic fluid under

pressure is directed into the cylinders by valves actuated by the cockpit flight
controls.
booster coil (ignition system component). An induction coil excited by pulsating
DC supplied by the aircraft battery and a vibrator. Booster coils produce a high
voltage, which is directed to an auxiliary trailing finger on the rotor of the
magneto distributor. When this high voltage jumps to ground across the
electrodes of the spark plug, it produces a hot and late spark for starting the
engine.
booster magneto. A small, auxiliary, hand-cranked magneto used with some of
the older aircraft engines to provide a hot, retarded spark for starting the engine.
bootstrapping. A self-initiating or self-sustaining action. In a turbocharger
system, bootstrapping describes a transient increase in engine power that causes
the turbocharger to speed up, which in turn causes the engine to produce more
power. The word bootstrap comes from the figure of speech “a person lifts
himself by his own bootstraps.”
bore (dimension). The diameter of a round hole. The distance across the hole at
its widest point.
bore (engine dimension). The diameter of the inside of the cylinder of a
reciprocating engine.
borescope (inspection instrument). An instrument used to examine the inside of a
structure through a very small hole. The inside of a turbine engine and the inside
of the cylinder of a reciprocating engine, for example, can be examined by
inserting the probe of the borescope through a small inspection hole or through a
spark plug hole.
A borescope furnishes its own light, and some borescopes have different ranges
of magnification. Some borescopes are fitted to a camera to photograph the
inside of the structure. A modern trend in borescopes is to place a video pickup
on the borescope tube and display the results on a small television screen.
boric acid. A white crystal (H3BO3) that can be dissolved in water to make a
weak acid solution. A boric acid solution can be used to neutralize spilled
electrolyte from nickel-cadmium batteries.
boring (machining operation). A method of increasing the size of a hole in a
piece of material by cutting it with a rotary cutting tool.

boron. A soft, brown, nonmetallic, trivalent chemical element. Boron’s symbol
is B, its atomic number is 5, and its atomic weight is 10.811. Boron is used to
add stiffness and strength to some of the modern composite structural materials,
and to dope silicon or germanium to make a P-type semiconductor material.
boron fiber (composites). A fiber, usually of a tungsten-filament core, with
elemental boron vapor deposited on it to impart strength and stiffness properties.
boss. An enlarged area in a casting or machined part. A boss provides additional
material to strengthen the part where holes are drilled for mounting or attaching
parts.
bottle bar. A special bucking bar with a recessed hole to hold a rivet set.
bottled gas. Any gas stored in heavy steel containers, with the gas kept under
pressure. Acetylene, propane, oxygen, and nitrogen are commonly used bottled
gases.
bottom. See cone bottoming.
bottom dead center (reciprocating engine piston position). The position of the
piston in a reciprocating engine cylinder when the piston is at the bottom of its
stroke and the wrist pin, crankpin, and center of the crankshaft are all in line.

bottoming reamer (metalworking tool). A reamer used to smooth and enlarge
blind holes. The blades of a bottoming reamer are parallel; they have no taper.

bottoming tap (metalworking tool). A tool used to cut threads all the way to the
bottom of a hole. A bottoming tap has a flat end and no taper. It is used after the
hole has been partially tapped with a plug tap.
bottom-of-descent point. The end point of the descent, as calculated by the
FMS/RNAV.
boundary layer (aerodynamics). The layer of air that flows next to an
aerodynamic surface. Because of the design of the surface and local surface
roughness, the boundary layer often has a random flow pattern, sometimes even
flowing in a direction opposite to the direction of flight. A turbulent boundary
layer causes a great deal of aerodynamic drag.
boundary-layer control. A method of decreasing aerodynamic drag caused by the
turbulent flow of the boundary layer. Boundary-layer control can use either a
high-velocity blast of air to blow the random-flowing air off the surface, or it can
use a low pressure inside the structure to suck the boundary layer air off the
surface through tiny holes or slots.
boundary lights. Lights defining the perimeter of an airport or landing area. See
airport lighting.
Bourdon tube. The measuring element used in certain types of pressuremeasuring instruments. A thin-walled metal tube, having an elliptical cross
section, is formed into a curve. One end of the tube is sealed and is connected to
an arm that moves a pointer. The other end of the tube is open and is secured to
the instrument case. The pressure to be measured is connected to the open end of
the tube, and this pressure causes the elliptical cross section to try to become
round and thus begin to straighten the tube. The amount the tube straightens is
proportional to the pressure inside the tube, and as it straightens, it moves a
pointer across the calibrated instrument dial.
bow. Front end of floats or the hull of a flying boat.
BOW (basic operating weight). The weight of an aircraft, including the crew,
ready for flight but without payload and fuel. This term applies only to transport
category aircraft.

spring steel wire, enclosed inside a helically wound wire casing. A Bowden
cable transmits both pushing and pulling motion to the device being actuated.

Bowden cable systems are often used for moving such aircraft engine controls as
the throttle and the mixture control.
bowline knot. A handy knot used for such aeronautical purposes as securing an
aircraft to prevent wind damage. A properly tied bowline knot will not slip, and
it is easy to untie.
bow wave (supersonic aircraft flight). A shock wave which forms when an
aircraft is flying at a speed faster than the speed of sound, a speed greater than
Mach one. A bow wave either forms immediately ahead of the aircraft or is
attached to the nose of the aircraft.
box beam (aircraft structural member). The main spanwise structural member of
a wing made in the form of a box. Tensile and compressive stresses are carried
in the top and the bottom of the box beam, and the sides act as webs to give the
beam rigidity. The top and bottom of the box beam oppose the greatest loads and
are the strongest parts of the beam. A box beam is also called a box spar.

box brake (metal-forming shop tool). A metal-forming machine similar to a leaf,
or cornice, brake. It is used to make straight bends across a piece of sheet metal.
The holding jaws of a box brake are made in the form of fingers. All four sides
of a box can be formed on a box brake by allowing the sides that have been bent
to fit between the fingers of the clamp while the last bends are being made. A
box brake is also called a finger brake.
boxing of paint. A mixing procedure in which the pigment in a can of paint is
thoroughly mixed with the vehicle. The paint is poured back and forth between
two containers until the pigment and the vehicle are completely and uniformly
mixed.
box spar. See box beam.

box wrench (mechanic’s hand tool). A wrench with an enclosed end shaped with
six, eight, or twelve points to fit a square- or hexagonal-head bolt or nut. Box
wrenches can be used in close spaces, and they can be used to apply a greater
force than can be applied with an open-end wrench.
Boyle’s law. One of the basic gas laws, which states that the product found by
multiplying the pressure of a gas by its volume is always constant. If the volume
of a container of gas is decreased without changing the absolute temperature of
the gas, the pressure of the gas will increase.
brace. A part of a structure that supports or strengthens the main load-carrying
portion of the structure.
bracing wires. High strength steel wires with threaded ends used to align and
stabilize some flight surfaces and floats.
bracketing (flight procedure). A series of minor corrections left or right as
required, to maintain or regain the desired course.
brad. A thin wire nail with a small-diameter, barrel-shaped head.
brad-point drill. A special drill used for drilling cured Kevlar-reinforced
composite materials. The tendency of Kevlar fibers to pull and stretch when they
are cut with a drill is minimized by using a brad-point drill.

braid (electrical shielding and bonding component). A woven metal tube used to
encase a wire carrying alternating current. This braid, called shielding, intercepts
the electromagnetic field produced by the AC and prevents the field causing
radio interference. Braid can also be flattened and used as a bonding strap, to
conduct static electricity away from a component insulated by shock mounts.
Bonding helps reduce static electricity that causes radio interference.

brake, cornice brake, finger brake, and press brake.
brake back plate (aircraft landing gear component). A floating plate in an
energizing-type brake to which the wheel cylinder and the brake shoes attach.

propeller shaft (main drive or main output) of an aircraft engine.”
brake line. See sight line.
brake lining (aircraft landing gear component). A material with a high
coefficient of friction and the ability to maintain its friction and strength when it
is hot. Brake linings were at one time made with asbestos, but modern brake
linings contain no asbestos.
brake mean effective pressure. See BMEP.
brake puck. Small, easily replaceable pads of brake lining material used in disk
brakes. One or more pucks are on each side of the disk, and when the brakes are
applied the pucks are forced tightly against the disk to supply the required
friction. See brake lining (aircraft landing gear component).
brake specific fuel consumption. See BSFC.
braking action advisories. A condition noted in an ATIS broadcast when the
tower has received a runway braking action report of “poor” or “nil.”When a
braking action advisory is in effect, ATC will issue the latest braking action
report for the runway in use to all arriving and departing pilots.

brashness (wood condition). A condition of wood which causes it to have low
shock resistance so that it fails abruptly when it is bent.
brass. An alloy of copper and zinc made up of approximately 67% copper and
33% zinc. Brass is malleable and ductile and is used for certain types of aircraft
hardware and locking wire (safety wire) where corrosion resistance is important.
Brayton thermodynamic cycle. The constant-pressure cycle of energy release
used to describe the action of a gas turbine engine. Fuel is added to the air
passing through the engine and is burned. Heat from the burning fuel-air mixture
expands the air, and since this air is not confined, it accelerates as it moves
through the engine. The Brayton cycle, a constant-pressure cycle, is an open
cycle because all the events, compression, combustion, expansion, and exhaust
take place at the same time, but in different locations within the engine.
The Brayton cycle differs from the Otto cycle used in reciprocating engines
because the Otto cycle is a constant-volume cycle. See Otto thermodynamic
cycle.
braze welding. A method of joining pieces of metal by wetting their surfaces
with a molten brass alloy. The brass rod used for braze welding melts at a
temperature above 800°F, but below the melting temperature of the metals being
joined. Braze welding differs from brazing in that it does not use capillary action
to pull the molten alloy between the pieces of metal being joined.
brazier-head rivet. A thin protruding-head rivet that was at one time popular for
aircraft sheet metal construction. Brazier-head rivets have been superseded and
may be replaced by MS20470 (AN 470) universal-head rivets.
brazing. A method of joining metals by allowing capillary action to pull molten,
nonferrous filler metal between close-fitting parts. When the filler metal
solidifies, it holds the parts together. Brazing differs from soldering in the
melting temperature of the filler metals used. Soldering uses filler metals that
melt at temperatures below 800°F, and brazing metals melt at temperatures
above 800°F.
breadboard (electrical circuit). A device for building experimental electrical
circuits that allows the components to be temporarily connected into the circuit,
making it easy to exchange components. After a circuit functions as it should on

the breadboard, and all the correct components are chosen, the circuit is
redesigned into its final configuration.
Many modern circuits are first built on solderless breadboards that allow the
substitution of parts without their having to be soldered into the circuit.

placed across the dielectric in an electrical or electronic component to cause the
dielectric to break down and conduct current.
breaker-point bounce. A condition in which the breaker points in an aircraft
magneto bounce open, rather than remaining closed when the cam follower
moves off of the cam lobe. Breaker-point bounce is caused by a weak breakerpoint spring.
breaker points (magneto component). Electrical contacts in the primary circuit of
an aircraft magneto that are opened by a cam turned by the engine. The breaker
points are timed to open at the instant the ignition spark should occur. When the
points open, the primary current stops flowing, and its magnetic field collapses.
The lines of flux from the collapsing primary magnetic field cut across the
many turns of the secondary winding and induce a high voltage in the secondary
circuit. It is this high secondary voltage that causes a spark to jump across the
gap in the spark plug.

breakers (tire component). Layers of reinforcing fabric (cords) in an aircraft tire
between the casing plies and the tread rubber. Breakers protect the casing plies
and strengthen the tire.
breakout (air traffic control). A technique used to direct aircraft out of the
approach stream. In the context of close parallel operations, a breakout is used to
direct threatened aircraft away from a deviating aircraft.
breast drill. A handheld drill motor used to drill relatively large holes in wood or
metal. The handle of the drill motor is fitted with a curved plate that allows the
user to apply a pushing force with his upper body as the drill cuts the hole.
breather (engine lubricating system). A vent line in an aircraft engine that allows
the air pressure inside the engine crankcase to be the same as the pressure of the
surrounding air. An effective breather system prevents pressure building up
inside the engine and forcing oil out of the crankcase.
breather-pressurizing valve (turbine engine lubrication system component). An
aneroid-operated valve in the overboard vent line of the lubrication system of
some turbine engines. The breather-pressurizing valve is open at sea level, but
closes with increasing altitude to maintain sea level pressure inside the vent
system as the aircraft goes up in altitude.
breech chamber (cartridge-pneumatic starter). A locking chamber in a cartridge
starter that holds a pyrotechnic cartridge (a powder charge). The cartridge is
placed in the breech, the breech is closed and locked, and the cartridge is fired.
The expanding gases produced by the burning powder spin the turbine in the
starter.
breeder reactor (nuclear energy). A reactor that produces fissionable material as
well as consuming it.
bridge circuit (electrical circuit). An electrical circuit containing four
impedances connected in such a way that their schematic diagram forms a
square. One pair of diagonally opposite corners is connected to an input device,
and the other two corners are connected to the output device. See illustration for
balanced bridge.
bridge-type rectifier. An electrical rectifier circuit using four diodes to change
alternating current into full-wave rectified direct current.

bridging (composites). The condition in which fibers do not move into or
conform to radii and corners during molding. This results in voids and
dimensional control problems.
briefing. An oral presentation where the speaker presents a concise array of facts
without inclusion of extensive supporting material.
bright band (radar meteorology). A narrow, intense echo on the range-height
indicator scope resulting from water-covered ice particles of high reflectivity at
the melting level.
brine (heat treatment of metal). A solution of salt (sodium chloride) and water,
used as a quenching medium in the heat treatment of metal. Steel parts quenched
in brine are harder than parts quenched in either water or oil.
Brinell hardness test. A method of measuring the hardness of metal. A hardened
steel sphere is pressed into the surface of the metal by a specific force and is held
for a specified period of time. The force is removed and the diameter of the
indentation caused by the ball is measured with a special microscope. The larger
the diameter of the dent, the softer the metal.
brinelling (bearing damage). A form of damage to the hardened surface of a
bearing roller or race caused by excessive radial loads on the bearings. When a
bearing is overloaded, the rollers are forced into the race, and they leave small
dips (indentations) in the race or flat spots on the surface of the roller. Bearings
that have been brinelled must be replaced.
British thermal unit. See Btu.
brittleness. A physical characteristic of a material that causes it to break, or
fracture, without bending or distorting in any appreciable amount. Brittleness is
the opposite of malleability.

C = Capacitance in farads
capacitive time constant. The amount of time, measured in seconds, needed for
the voltage across a capacitor to rise to 63.2% of the source voltage. The time
constant is determined by the resistance and the capacitance of the circuit.
The formula for capacitive time constant is:
TC = R · C
TC = Time constant in seconds
R = Resistance in ohms
C = Capacitance in farads

capacitor. An electrical component made of two conductors separated by an
insulator, or dielectric. A capacitor can store an electrical charge in an
electrostatic field. The capacitance of a capacitor is measured in farads,
microfarads (10–6 farad), or picofarads (10–12 farad).
The capacitance of a capacitor is determined by three things: the area of the
plates, the amount of separation between the plates, and the kind of insulating
material, or dielectric, between the plates. Capacitors were at one time called
condensers.

capacitor-discharge ignition system (gas turbine engine ignition system). A type
of high-energy ignition system that produces a hot spark for starting a gas
turbine engine. In a capacitor-discharge ignition system, electrons are stored
under high voltage in capacitors. When these electrons are released, they cause a
high-intensity spark to jump across the gap in the igniters.

capacitor-input filter (electronic filter). A type of electrical filter used to smooth
the pulsations in the output of an electronic power supply. A capacitor is
installed in parallel with the rectifier output, and an inductor is in series.
capacitor-start induction motor. An AC motor whose rotor is excited by voltage
induced into it from the stator windings. A capacitor-start motor has two stator
windings: a start winding and a run winding. The start winding is in series with a
capacitor that shifts the phase of the current flowing through it, so it is out of
phase with the current flowing through the run winding.
The magnetic field produced by the start winding and the field produced by the
run winding work together to produce a magnetic field that rotates within the
motor housing. The rotor follows this rotating field. When the rotor has
accelerated to a specified speed, a centrifugal switch opens the start winding
circuit, and the motor continues to operate on the run winding alone. Capacitorstart motors have a good starting torque.
capacity (battery specification). The total amount of current available in a battery
or electrical cell. Capacity is normally measured in ampere-hours.
cap cloud (meteorology). A standing, or stationary, cap-like cloud that forms on
mountain or ridge tops caused by cooling of moist air rising on the upwind side,
followed by warming and drying by downdrafts on the lee side. Also called a
foehn cloud. See also foehn.
cape chisel. A narrow-blade cold chisel with either a single or double bevel.
Cape chisels are used to knock the head off a rivet after it has been drilled
through, and to cut narrow grooves and keyways in metal components.

capillary action. The action that causes a liquid to climb the walls of a container
or to be drawn up into extremely tiny tubes or between close-fitting parts.
The force of adhesion between the liquid and the solid wall of the container is

greater than the force of cohesion between the molecules of the liquid. The
stronger force of adhesion causes the liquid to try to spread out and wet the
walls. Capillary action causes a piece of blotting paper to pick up a liquid, and
the lack of capillary action causes a drop of water to form into a ball on a waxed
surface.
capillary tube. A metal or glass tube with such a small inside diameter that
capillary action causes liquid to move in the tube. A soft copper capillary tube is
used with a vapor-pressure thermometer connecting the temperature-sensing
bulb to the Bourdon tube. The tube is protected from physical damage by
enclosing it in a braided metal wire jacket.
capping (meteorology). A statically stable layer at the top of the atmospheric
boundary layer. This term is used more loosely for any stable layer (potential
temperature increasing with height) at the top of the boundary layer.
capsize. To overturn.
cap screw. A threaded fastener whose shank passes through a clear hole in one
piece of material and screws into threads cut into the second piece. The head of
the cap screw, which is turned with a wrench, clamps the two pieces of material
together.
capstan (aircraft controls). A device in the control system of an aircraft that
allows the automatic pilot to move the control surfaces.
The capstan is a grooved drum-like wheel mounted on the automatic pilot
servo motor. A bridle of control cable is wound around the capstan, and the ends
of the bridle are attached to the aileron, elevator, or rudder control cable. When
the servo motor turns, it winds the bridle around the capstan, and the bridle
moves the main control cable.

capstan screw. A form of machine screw whose head has several radial holes,
holes that go across the head, through it. A bar can be passed through these holes
and used to turn the screw.
cap strip. The main top and bottom members of a wing rib. The cap strips give
the rib its aerodynamic shape.
capsule (aircraft instrument component). A flat container made of thin disks of
corrugated metal soldered together and used to sense changing pressure. When
the pressure inside the capsule changes, the capsule expands or contracts, and the
change in its physical dimensions is proportional to the change in the pressure.
captive balloon. A lighter-than-air device anchored to the ground with a steel
cable. Captive balloons were used in the American Civil War as aerial
observation platforms. In both World War I and World War II, captive balloons
were used as obstructions to keep low-flying airplanes from bombing and
strafing vital ground installations.
captive screw. A screw that has a section of the threads on its shank next to its
head cut away. A captive screw is free to turn in the body in which it is mounted,
but it will not drop out when it is unscrewed from the part it is holding.
carbide. A chemical compound of carbon and a metallic element. Carbides are
normally very hard materials.
carbide tool (machine tool). A metal-cutting machine tool whose cutting faces
are surfaced with tungsten carbide, tantalum carbide, or titanium carbide. These
carbides keep their hardness and cutting ability even when they are extremely
hot.
Carboloy. The registered trade name for certain cutting tools and dies that have
tungsten carbide bonded to their cutting or wearing surfaces.
carbon. An abundant, nonmetallic chemical element that occurs in all organic
compounds and in many inorganic compounds. Carbon’s symbol is C, its atomic
number is 6, and its atomic weight is 12.01115. Among carbon’s many
important uses is that of acting as an electrical resistance element.
carbon arc. An electric arc produced when current flows through ionized air
from the tip of one carbon rod to the tip of another. The intense heat produced by
the passage of the current causes the tips of the carbon rods to vaporize and glow
with a brilliant white light.

carbon black. A form of soft and fluffy carbon. Carbon black is produced by
burning certain types of gas with a flame that contains insufficient oxygen for
complete combustion. Carbon black is used in the manufacture of aircraft tires
and as a pigment for some types of paint.
carbon brake (aircraft brake). A special multiple-disk brake using pure carbon
for both rotating and stationary disks. Carbon brakes are used on some highperformance aircraft because of their ability to dissipate much more energy than
a metal-disk brake of similar weight.
carbon deposits (engine operation). A deposit of hard carbon that forms on
engine parts when lubricating oil is trapped in a hot location, allowing it to
decompose into hard carbon, or coke. See coking (lubrication system problem).
carbon dioxide (CO2). A colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas that is about 1.5
times as heavy as air. Carbon dioxide, composed of one atom of carbon and two
atoms of oxygen, makes up about five hundredths of one percent of the air we
breathe. Green plants take in carbon dioxide and combine it with water to make
sugar. Humans and animals give off carbon dioxide in their exhaled breath.
Even though carbon dioxide makes up only an extremely small part of the air
we breathe, it is necessary, because it helps control our rate of breathing. Carbon
dioxide is important commercially because of its use as a fire extinguishing
agent.
carbon dioxide fire extinguisher. A fire extinguisher that holds carbon dioxide
gas under a pressure of about 800 to 900 pounds per square inch. When carbon
dioxide, CO2, is sprayed on a fire, it comes out of the extinguisher in the form of
a snow and blankets the fire. The snow changes into CO2 gas and pushes away
all the oxygen. When there is no more oxygen to combine with the fuel, the fire
goes out.
carbon fiber (composites). A reinforcing fiber known for its light weight, high
strength, and stiffness. It is produced from an organic fiber by breaking down
complex molecules into simpler molecules by heat in an inert atmosphere at
temperatures above 1,800°F.
carbon-film resistor (electrical component). An electrical resistor made by
vacuum-depositing a thin film of carbon on a ceramic cylinder. Wires attached
to each end of the carbon film allow the resistor to be connected into an
electrical circuit.

carbon fouling (spark plug condition). A spark plug condition, identified by dull
black, sooty deposits in the electrode end of the plug. Common causes of carbon
fouling are excessive ground idling with a rich idle mixture, and the use of a
spark plug with too cold a heat range.
carbon knock (reciprocating engines). The knocking sound made in a
reciprocating engine by detonation that follows preignition. Preignition occurs
when incandescent (red-hot) carbon particles inside the cylinder ignite the fuelair mixture before the engine is ready for ignition to occur. Early ignition allows
the cylinder pressure and temperature to build up high enough to cause the fuel
to detonate, or explode, rather than burn smoothly as it should. It is this
explosion that causes the sound we hear.
carbon microphone. A type of microphone used in a telephone and with some
types of radio transmitters. The sensitive element in a carbon microphone is a
tube of carbon granules, or grains of carbon. A flexible diaphragm acted on by
sound waves presses against the carbon inside the tube. When the diaphragm
pushes the carbon granules together (compresses them), the resistance of the
carbon becomes less than when the diaphragm allows the granules to relax. The
looseness or tightness of the granules in the tube determines the resistance of the
carbon, and this resistance changes in the same way the air pressure caused by
the sound waves changes.
carbon monoxide (CO). A colorless, odorless gas that forms from incomplete
combustion of an organic fuel. Carbon monoxide is poisonous to human and
animal life.
carbon monoxide detector. A packet of chemical crystals mounted in the aircraft
cockpit or cabin where they are easily visible. The crystals change their color
from yellow to green when they are exposed to carbon monoxide.
carbon pile (electrical component). A type of variable resistor used in some
electrical equipment. A carbon pile is made of a stack of thin, pure carbon disks
whose resistance is changed by varying the pressure on the stack. Carbon piles
are used as the control element in some types of voltage regulators. They are
also used for dissipating (using up) large amounts of electrical power in certain
types of electrical load banks and test equipment.
carbon pile voltage regulator. A voltage regulator used with some high-output
DC generators in which a stack of pure carbon disks acts as the resistance

element in the field circuit. When the generator output voltage is low, a spring
compresses the carbon pile and reduces its resistance, allowing a large amount of
field current to flow.
When the generator output is high, the electro-magnetic field produced by a
voltage-sensing coil overcomes the spring force and loosens the carbon pile,
increasing its resistance and decreasing the field current.

carbon resistor (electrical component). A component used to insert a controlled
amount of resistance into an electrical circuit.
Carbon resistors are made of a mixture of carbon and an insulating material
formed into a small cylinder and baked. Its resistance is then measured and its
value marked in the form of colored bands around one end.
carbon seal (gas turbine engine component). A rubbing seal in a gas turbine
engine between a rotating shaft and a fixed housing. The seal, made of carbon,
rides on a highly polished steel surface, and the close fit between the carbon and
the steel keeps oil from flowing into the gas path of the engine.
carbon steel. Steel in which carbon is the chief, or principal, alloying agent.
Low-carbon steel which, containing less than 0.20% carbon, is relatively soft
and weak, but high-carbon steel containing up to about 0.95% carbon can be
hardened until it is very strong, but also very brittle.
carbon tetrachloride. A colorless, dense, liquid halogenated hydrocarbon that
has, in the past, been used as a fire extinguishing agent and as a cleaning fluid
for clothing. Carbon tetrachloride is no longer used for either of these purposes

because it is harmful to the human body. When carbon tetrachloride is sprayed
on a fire, it changes into the poisonous gas, phosgene.
carbon tracking (magneto distributor malfunction). An ignition system
malfunction caused by a fine track of carbon deposited inside the distributor of
an aircraft magneto. The resistance of the air inside the distributor at high
altitude is so low that it is possible for a spark to jump between the distributor
terminals. As this spark moves across the surface of the distributor block, it
leaves a thin track of carbon. The resistance of this carbon track is so much
lower than that of the material of which the distributor block is made that high
voltage leaks through it during normal engine operation. This high-voltage
leakage can cause misfiring, loss of engine power, and possible engine damage.
carbon-zinc cell (electrical cell). An electrochemical cell that changes chemical
energy into electrical energy. The cell is made of a zinc can filled with a paste of
ammonium chloride. A carbon rod is supported by the ammonium chloride in
such a way that it cannot touch the zinc can.
Electrical energy is produced as electrons leave the zinc can and travel through
an external circuit to the carbon rod. A carbon-zinc cell has an open-circuit
voltage of approximately 1.5 volts.

Carborundum. The registered trade name for several types of man-made
abrasives. Carborundum is similar to emery (a natural abrasive), and it is used to
make grinding wheels. Fine particles of Carborundum are bonded to paper and
cloth to make sheets and strips of abrasive materials.

carburetor (reciprocating engine component). A type of fuel metering system
used on some reciprocating engines. When air flows into the engine, it passes
through a venturi in the carburetor. The venturi produces a pressure drop
proportional to the volume of air flowing into the engine cylinders.
The low pressure caused by the venturi pulls the correct amount of fuel through
a metering jet, and this fuel is mixed with the air before it enters the cylinders.
carburetor air heater. A sheet metal jacket surrounding part of the engine exhaust
system. Air from inside the engine nacelle or compartment flows between this
jacket and the exhaust system component and picks up heat. The heated air is
carried through a carburetor heater valve, and when carburetor air temperature is
low, can be directed into the carburetor; otherwise it is dumped overboard. Air
that flows through the carburetor air heater is not filtered.
carburetor air temperature. The temperature of the air as it enters the carburetor.
It is important that the temperature of the fuel-air mixture be kept above the
freezing point of water to prevent the formation of carburetor ice, but it is
difficult to measure the temperature of this mixture. By measuring and
controlling the temperature of the air as it enters the carburetor, it is possible to
keep the mixture temperature high enough to prevent water condensing out of
the air and freezing, and at the same time to keep the temperature of the air
entering the engine low enough to prevent detonation.
carburetor air temperature gage. An instrument that indicates the temperature of
the air in the ram air intake duct before it enters the carburetor. Keeping this air
temperature sufficiently above the freezing point of water prevents ice forming
in the throat of the carburetor.
carburetor ice. Ice that forms inside the throat of a carburetor installed on an
aircraft reciprocating engine. When air flows through the carburetor venturi, it
speeds up, and both its pressure and temperature drop. When liquid fuel is
discharged into the throat of the venturi, it vaporizes, and this change of state
drops its temperature.
When the temperature of the air is low enough, moisture in the air condenses
out and freezes. It is possible for carburetor ice to build up inside the venturi and
restrict the air flowing into the engine enough to cause the engine to stop.
Carburetor ice is normally prevented by heating the air before it enters the
carburetor.
carburizing (steel heat treatment). A form of heat treatment of steel in which the

surface absorbs extra carbon and becomes hard and brittle, while the center of
the steel remains relatively soft and tough.
The part to be carburized is packed in a material containing a large amount of
carbon (finely ground bone is often used) and is heated in a furnace until the
correct amount of carbon is absorbed into the surface of the steel.
carburizing flame (oxy-acetylene welding). A flame produced by an oxyacetylene torch when there is too much acetylene gas for the amount of oxygen
being metered by the torch. A carburizing flame, identified by a definite feather
around the inner cone, is not normally used, because it adds carbon to the molten
metal and makes the weld weaker than the metal being welded.
carcass (tire component). The layers of rubberized fabric that make up the body
of an aircraft tire.
cardinal altitudes. Odd or even thousand-foot altitudes or flight levels.
cardinal heading (aircraft navigation). The heading of an aircraft along any of
the four cardinal directions shown on a compass. The cardinal directions are
North, East, South, and West.
cardioid microphone. A microphone that is directional in its ability to pick up
sounds, picking up sounds in front of it while rejecting sounds behind it. A
cardioid microphone gets its name from the Greek word kardia, which means
heart. The sound pickup pattern of a cardioid microphone is roughly in the shape
of a heart.
caret (mathematics). A small inverted V (^) used to show the new location of the
decimal in multiplication and division problems using decimal fractions.
cargo. Material transported in an airplane, ship, truck, or train.
Carnot cycle (energy release cycle). An ideal reversible, but unattainable, cycle
of energy transformation that explains the operation of a perfect heat engine. The
four events that occur in a Carnot cycle are:
1. An isothermal expansion of the working fluid from A to B. Heat energy is
neither added to nor taken from the air. The temperature remains constant at
T1.
2. An adiabatic expansion from B to C with the temperature changing from T1
to T2.
3. An isothermal compression from C to D at temperature T2.

4. An adiabatic compression of the gas from D to A, returning it to its original
conditions.

carriage bolt. A round-headed bolt with a square section of the shank just below
the head. A carriage bolt is used to hold pieces of wood together. The square
section of the shank embeds itself in the wood and keeps the bolt from turning
when the nut is tightened on the threads.
carrier frequency (radio transmission). The frequency of the alternating current
carrier that produces the electromagnetic waves which radiate from a radio
transmitting antenna. The audio-frequency signal from the microphone
modulates (changes the amplitude or the frequency) of the carrier.
cart. The engine and seats, attached by a structure to wheels; sometimes referred
to as the fuselage, cockpit, chaise, or airframe.
cartridge fuse (electrical component). A type of fuse used to protect an electrical
circuit from an excess of current. The fusible link, the part of the fuse that melts
when too much current flows through it, is held between metal ferrules, or caps,
that screw onto each end of an insulating tube. The ferrules are held in special
fuse clips inside the fuse box.
cartridge-pneumatic starter (gas turbine engine starter). A pneumatic starter for a
gas turbine engine that uses gas pressure produced when powder in a cartridge
burns in the breech of the starter. The high-pressure gas produced by the burning
powder spins a turbine geared to the engine compressor.

cartridge starter (reciprocating engine starter). A type of starter used on some
large aircraft reciprocating engines. A cartridge, looking much like a shotgun
cartridge, is fired in the breech of the starter. The gas produced by the burning
powder pushes down on a piston inside a cylinder. The piston is attached to a
helical spline, a spline cut in the shape of a spiral, in such a way that as the
piston moves down, the spline twists. The twisting spline turns a gear that
meshes with a gear on the engine crankshaft. When the cartridge is fired and the
piston is pushed down, the helical spline turns the gear and cranks the engine
fast enough for it to start.
cartridge-type fluid filter (fuel and oil filter). A disposable filter element used in
an aircraft fuel or lubrication system. These filters are of the depth type and are
made of cellulose fibers that trap and hold most of the contaminants in the fuel
or oil that passes through them.
CAS (calibrated airspeed). A measure of the speed at which an aircraft is moving
through the air. Calibrated airspeed is found by correcting the airspeed shown on
the airspeed indicator, the indicated airspeed (IAS), for any errors in the
instrument or those caused by its installation (installation, or position errors).
See position error.
14 CFR Part 1: “The indicated airspeed of an aircraft, corrected for position
and instrument error. Calibrated airspeed is equal to true airspeed in standard
atmosphere at sea level.”
cascade (electrical circuits). A method of connecting multiple stages of electrical
circuits so the output of one stage feeds the input of the next stage.
cascade effect. The cumulative effect that occurs when the output of one series
of components serves as the input to the next series.
cascade reverser (thrust reverser). A thrust reverser normally used on turbofan
engines. A blocker door and a series of cascade vanes redirect exhaust gases in a
forward direction.
cascade transformer (electrical equipment). A device that can be used in an
electrical circuit to get a high voltage. The secondary winding of a step-up
transformer is connected to the primary winding of another step-up transformer.
As many transformers as are needed to get the required output voltage can be
cascaded in this manner.
cascade vanes (thrust reverser component). Vanes in an aerodynamic blockage-

type thrust reverser used to turn the stream of exhaust gases to produce a reverse
thrust.
case hardening (steel heat treatment). A method of heat treatment of steel in
which the surface of the metal is hardened while its inside stays strong and
tough. Case hardening may be done by causing the steel on the surface to absorb
extra carbon or by changing the surface into a very hard chemical compound
called aluminum nitride.
Case hardening is used on such steel parts as engine crankshafts. Only the
surfaces where the bearings ride are made very hard and brittle. The inside of the
crankshaft remains tough and strong.
casein glue. A form of powdered glue made from milk. Casein glue powder is
mixed with cold water to form a creamy paste. Casein glue was formerly used
for joining wood parts of aircraft, but it is no longer used because better types of
glue are now available.
case pressure (fluid pump pressure). A relatively low pressure maintained inside
the bearing cavities of an engine-driven hydraulic pump. If the shaft or the
bearings (bushings) of the pump should become damaged, case pressure will
force hydraulic fluid out of the pump, rather than allowing air to be pulled in.
casing (aircraft tire component). The rubber and fabric body of a pneumatic tire.
The casing is the same as the carcass of the tire.
casing nail. A form of wire nail made of smaller gage wire than that used for a
common nail of the same length.
castellated nut. A form of hexagonal nut (a six-sided nut) that has slots cut
across its end. A cotter pin is passed through the slots and through a hole in the
shank of the bolt to lock the nut to the bolt. Castellated nuts are often called
castle nuts.
casting. A method of forming an object by pouring molten metal or liquid plastic
resin into a mold. The material is allowed to harden inside the mold and, when
hard, it is removed. Castings are less expensive than forgings, but they usually
have much less strength. Reciprocating engine crankcases are normally castings.
cast iron. Iron that contains carbon and silicon. Cast iron is heavy, brittle, and
hard, and cannot be formed by forging. It is used for making objects that do not
require a great deal of strength and can be made by pouring the molten iron into

molds. The main use of cast iron in aircraft technology is in the manufacture of
piston rings for reciprocating engines.
cast off (seaplane operation). To release or untie a seaplane from its mooring.
CAT (clear air turbulence). Extreme turbulence found at high altitude. Clear air
turbulence is created when a difference in the temperature causes a violent
movement of the air. CAT cannot be seen, because there is no moisture at the
altitude at which it occurs. In the lower altitudes, where there is moisture,
turbulence in the air causes recognizable cloud patterns.
catalyst. A substance used to change the speed or rate of a chemical action
without being chemically changed itself. Water functions as a catalyst in the
process of iron turning into rust (iron oxide). Dry iron does not rust nearly as fast
as iron with water on its surface. The water itself is not affected, but the iron
unites with oxygen from the air to become iron oxide, or rust.
catalytic cracking (petroleum refining). A method of refining petroleum
products. In catalytic cracking, a catalyst is used to change high-boiling-point
hydrocarbons into low-boiling-point hydrocarbons.
catalyzed resin (composites). A resin mixture that is in a workable state after it
has been mixed with catalyst or hardener.
catapult. A mechanism used to hurl, or launch, an object at a high rate of speed.
Catapults are used to launch heavily loaded aircraft from the decks of aircraft
carriers.
catch point (navigation). A fix/waypoint that serves as a transition point from the
high altitude waypoint navigation structure to an arrival procedure (STAR) or
the low altitude ground-based navigation structure.
category (aircraft classification). 14 CFR Part 1:
“(1) As used with respect to the certification, ratings, privileges, and
limitations of airmen, means a broad classification of aircraft. Examples
include: airplane; rotorcraft; glider; and lighter-than-air; and
(2) As used with respect to the certification of aircraft, means a grouping of
aircraft based upon intended use or operating limitations. Examples include:
transport, normal, utility, acrobatic, limited, restricted, and provisional.”
Category A. 14 CFR Part 1: “With respect to transport category rotorcraft,
means multiengine rotorcraft designed with engine and system isolation features

specified in Part 29 and utilizing scheduled takeoff and landing operations under
a critical engine failure concept which assures adequate designated surface area
and adequate performance capability for continued safe flight in the event of
engine failure.”
Category B. 14 CFR Part 1: “With respect to transport category rotorcraft,
means single-engine or multiengine rotorcraft which do not fully meet all
Category A standards. Category B rotorcraft have no guaranteed stay-up ability
in the event of engine failure and unscheduled landing is assumed.”
Category II operations. 14 CFR Part 1: “With respect to the operation of
aircraft, means a straight-in ILS approach to the runway of an airport under a
Category II ILS instrument approach procedure issued by the Administrator or
other appropriate authority.”
Category III operations. 14 CFR Part 1: “With respect to the operation of
aircraft, means an ILS approach to and landing on, the runway of an airport
using a Category III ILS approach procedure issued by the Administrator or
other appropriate authority.”
catenary curve. A curve formed by a flexible cable suspended between two
points at the same level.
cathedral (aerodynamics). Negative dihedral. The wings of an airplane, as they
are viewed from the front, are not usually straight; they normally angle upward
from the center. This upward angling is called positive dihedral, and it improves
the stability of the airplane. However, when maneuverability is more important
than stability, as it is on some military fighters and acrobatic airplanes, the wings
are set with negative dihedral (cathedral). The wings angle downward from the
center. Cathedral decreases the stability of an airplane and makes it more
maneuverable.
cathode of an electrochemical cell. The active element in an electrochemical cell
that is reduced, or loses oxygen in the chemical action which causes electrons to
flow.
cathode of a semiconductor diode. The end of a semiconductor diode made of Ntype material. When the diode is forward biased with the negative terminal of the
power source connected to the cathode of the diode, electrons flow through the
diode. The cathode of a semiconductor diode is identified by the bar in the diode
symbol.

cathode rays. Streams of electrons emitted by the cathode in a special form of
electron tube called a cathode-ray tube (CRT). These electrons are accelerated
by the attraction of a positive voltage on special grids called accelerator grids.
The cathode rays strike a phosphorescent material that covers the inside of the
face of the tube, and when they strike it, the material glows. Cathode-ray tubes
are used as the display in computers and oscilloscopes.
cathode-ray tube. See CRT.
cathodic area. An area within a piece of metal to which electrons from the
anodic area have migrated.
cathodic protection. Another name for sacrificial corrosion. A material that is
more anodic than the material being protected is attached to or plated on the
material. This becomes the anode and is corroded, while the part being protected
is the cathode and it is not damaged.
cation. A positive ion that moves toward the cathode in the process of
electrolysis.
catwalk. A narrow walkway inside a structure that allows a person to move
through an area that is otherwise inaccessible.

action. Both strong acids and strong aklalis are caustic materials.

caustic soda. A common name for sodium hydroxide, NaOH. Caustic soda is
often called lye.

pressure in the reservoir to force fluid to the inlet of the pump. The pump picks
up air instead of fluid.
cavity. An empty (unfilled) space. A cavity is the same as a hole.
C-battery (radio battery). A small, low-voltage battery used in some of the older,
battery-powered, tube-type radios to provide a grid bias voltage for some of the
vacuum tubes. C-batteries have generally been replaced by a method of biasing
the tubes with the voltage drop across a resistor.
CBI. See computer-based instruction.
CBT. See computer-based training.
C-check. See maintenance checks.
CCL (convective condensation level). The lowest level at which condensation
will occur as a result of convection due to surface heating. When condensation
occurs at this level, the layer between the surface and the CCL will be
thoroughly mixed, the temperature lapse rate will be dry adiabatic (3°C per
1,000 feet), and the mixing ratio will be constant.
C-clamp. A screw-type clamp made in the shape of the letter C. One jaw is
fixed, and the other is mounted on a screw.
CD. See compact disk.
CD duct. See convergent-divergent duct.
CDI (course deviation indicator). An indicator used with VOR, LORAN, or GPS
navigation systems to indicate the direction and relative amount of deviation
from the desired course. CDIs are often called Left-Right indicators.

system that contains a cathode-ray tube and a keyboard with alphanumeric keys
and mode-select and line-select keys. The CDU allows the flight crew to access
the data to be displayed.
Ceconite. The registered trade name for an inorganic aircraft fabric woven of
polyester fibers. Ceconite is installed on the structure and then shrunk with heat.

ceiling (meteorological condition). 14 CFR Part 1: “The height above the
earth’s surface of the lowest layer of clouds or obscuring phenomena reported as
‘broken,’ ‘overcast,’ or ‘obscuration,’ and not classified as ‘thin’ or ‘partial.’”
ceiling balloon (meteorology). A small, black, helium-filled balloon used to find
the height of a base of clouds. The balloon is released by a weather observer, and
the time needed for it to disappear into the clouds is measured. Since both the
rate of rise of the balloon and the time it took to disappear into the clouds are
known, the height of the base of the clouds can be determined.
ceiling light (meteorology). A light used by weather observers to measure the
height of the bottom of a layer of clouds at night. A beam of light, shone
vertically upward, makes a spot of light on the bottom of the cloud.
A theodolite (an instrument used to measure angles), located a known distance
away from the light, is used to measure the angle up to the spot of light on the
cloud base. By knowing the distance between the theodolite and the ceiling light
and the angle measured by the theodolite, the height of the cloud base can be
determined.
ceilometer (meteorology). A cloud-height measuring system. A ceilometer
projects a beam of light on the cloud base, detects the reflection by a
photoelectric cell, and determines the cloud-base height by triangulation.
celestial navigation. A form of navigation used by airplanes and ships. Location
fixes are found by observing the angle between the observer and one of the
navigational stars, and noting the exact time the observation is made. The exact
location of the navigational star at the time of the observation is found by
referring to a nautical almanac.
The location on the earth’s surface of the star at the time of observation and the
angle between the star and the observer are plotted on a navigational chart.
Celestial navigation has been almost entirely replaced by various forms of
electronic navigation, which are more accurate and easier to use.

CFR engine. A special test engine used by the Cooperative Fuel Research to
determine the octane rating of a hydrocarbon fuel. A CFR engine has a variable
compression ratio, and it can be adjusted to cause any fuel being tested to
detonate, or explode, rather than burn evenly. The fuel being tested is run in the
CFR engine and the compression ratio is adjusted until the fuel detonates.

With the engine adjusted to cause detonation, the fuel under test is shut off, and
a reference fuel, which is a mixture of iso-octane and normal heptane, is directed
into the engine. The ratio of the iso-octane to heptane is changed until the
reference fuel detonates the same as the fuel being tested.
The percentage of iso-octane in the reference fuel having the same detonation
characteristics in the CFR engine as the fuel being tested is the octane number
given the fuel.

etching away part of the surface. The inside of the skins of some highperformance aircraft are etched to remove metal not needed for strength.
Removing this metal by chemical milling reduces the weight of the aircraft.
Chemical milling produces a lightweight skin with all the needed strength and
rigidity far more economically than can be done with conventional machining or
by building up a skin with riveted-on stiffeners.
chemical oxygen candle system. An oxygen system used for emergency or

carried in special fireproof fixtures. When oxygen is needed, the candles are
ignited with a built in igniter, and oxygen flows into the tubing leading to the
masks.
chemical reaction. A change in the chemical nature (the chemical characteristics)
of elements when they unite to form a chemical compound. Hydrogen is a
lighter-than-air gas, and oxygen is also a gas. But when two atoms of hydrogen
unite with one atom of oxygen, one molecule of water (H2O), a liquid, is formed.
The compound water has different chemical characteristics from those of either
of the elements oxygen or hydrogen. When hydrogen and oxygen combine to
form water, a chemical reaction takes place.

that, at the normal operating temperature, the diameter of choke-ground
cylinders becomes uniform throughout.
choke-input filter (electronic filter). A form of filter used with an electronic

presence of moisture. When cobalt chloride is dry, it is deep blue in color, but
when it absorbs water, it turns pink. If a dehydrator element is blue, the
component it protects is dry. But if moisture gets into it, the silica-gel absorbs
some of the moisture, and the cobalt chloride turns pink.

battery has when it is discharged at a rate that will drop its cell voltage to a
specified low value in five minutes.
The ampere hour capacity of a battery at its five-minute discharge rate is much
lower than its capacity at the other discharge rates. The actual capacity at this
rate is given in the specifications the manufacturer issues for each battery.
cold-cranking simulation (lubricating oil specification). A method used for
specifying the characteristics of a lubricating oil at low temperature. Oils that
have been rated by this test are identified by the letter W (standing for Winter) in
their designation. For example, SAE 15W50.
cold cylinder test (air-cooled engine maintenance test). A maintenance test used
to identify the cylinder in an air-cooled engine which is not firing. When a
cylinder is not firing, the temperature of the exhaust stack near the head is colder
than the temperature measured at the same place on a cylinder that is firing
normally. Handheld temperature gages, called magic wands, can be used to find
the cold cylinder, but on most small engines the cold cylinder can be located by
feel.
cold dimpling (sheet metal work). A method of preparing a hole in sheet metal to
receive flush rivets. A male dimpling die forces the metal around the rivet hole
into a female die to form a depression into which the rivet head fits. A

In glider operations, a self-launch glider’s engine (or a glider’s sustainer
engine) can become cold-soaked to the point where an in-flight engine start can
be difficult or impossible to perform. This can occur due to long-term exposure
to cold such as after a long soaring flight at altitudes with cold temperatures, for
example, as in high-altitude wave soaring during the winter.
cold-solder joint (electrical wiring). A soldered connection in electrical wiring in
which the wires were moved before the solder solidified. A cold-solder joint has

Cold-solder joints are undesirable and must be reheated to melt the solder. The
solder must then be allowed to solidify completely before the joint is moved.
cold spark plug. A spark plug with a short path for the heat to travel between the
nose core insulator and the shell. A cold spark plug carries the heat away from
the nose core, so it can operate in a high-compression engine without the nose
core becoming too hot. Too hot a nose core can cause preignition in the cylinder.
cold stream (gas turbine engine). The British term for the fan discharge in a
turbofan engine.
cold-tank lubrication system (gas turbine engine lubrication system). A turbine

tolerances. Bungee shock cords use color codes to indicate the year and quarter
of the year in which they were made. Color codes are used to identify the type of
steel in steel bars and rods. Colored bands are used around aircraft plumbing to
identify the fluid being carried in the line.

have to be heated to produce the same color as the source of light being
measured. Color temperature is measured in degrees Kelvin (°K).
color tempering. A method of removing some of the brittleness from a piece of
steel being heat-treated. The steel part is heated red-hot and quenched in water,

temperature indicated by the color of the oxide that forms on its surface. When
the correct color of oxide forms, the heating is stopped, and the metal is again
quenched.

and a free turbine which drives the main engine compressor through a clutch and
a series of reduction gears.

fitted with a lead holder or ink pen to draw the circle.
compass (navigation instrument). A navigation instrument that indicates the
direction to the earth’s magnetic north pole. The simplest compasses use a small
permanent magnet mounted on a pivot and free to turn. It aligns itself with the

magnetic lines of flux that extend across the earth from the magnetic north pole
to the magnetic south pole.
compass card (magnetic compass component). A drum-like scale, marked in
degrees, from 0° to 360°, fastened around the float in an aircraft magnetic
compass. The magnets align the float with the earth’s magnetic field, and the
compass card, which is read opposite a fixed lubber line, shows the pilot the
direction the nose of the aircraft is pointed relative to magnetic north.
compass compensation. A maintenance procedure that corrects a magnetic
compass for deviation error. The aircraft is aligned on a compass rose, and the
compensating magnets in the compass case are adjusted to get the compass to
align with the direction marked on the rose. After the deviation error is
minimized on all headings, a compass correction card is filled out and mounted
on the instrument panel next to the compass. Compass compensation is also
called compass swinging.

approach procedure. The outer compass locator (LOM) is installed at the site of
the outer marker of an instrument landing system, and the middle compass
locator (LMM) is installed at the site of the middle marker.
compass north. The direction to which the magnets in an aircraft compass
actually point. The magnetic field with which the compass magnets align is the
combination of the earth’s magnetic field and local magnetic fields. These local

fields are caused by magnetized parts of the aircraft and by electrical current
flowing in the aircraft structure and in wires.
compass rose. A graduated circle painted on a ramp or taxiway of an airport.
Compass roses are laid out at a location where local magnetic fields are
minimum, and where traffic will not interfere with aircraft using the rose to have
their compasses swung (compensated).
The graduations of the compass rose are laid out with reference to magnetic
north, and they are marked every thirty degrees.
To compensate the compass, the aircraft is taxied over the compass rose so it
lines up with the directional marks of the rose. The compensating magnets in the
compass are adjusted to cause the compass to agree with the direction the
aircraft is pointed.
A compass rose is also the name of a small circle graduated in 360° increments
printed on some navigational charts to show the amount of compass variation at
different locations on the chart.

compass turns. Turns made, using the magnetic compass for heading reference.
When making compass-only turns, you must compensate for lead or lag created

by acceleration and deceleration errors in order to roll out on the desired
heading.
compensated cam (magneto component). The type of cam used to open the
breaker points in a magneto installed on a high-performance radial engine. The
master and link rod arrangement used in a radial engine causes the pistons in the
different cylinders to be a different linear distance from the top of their stroke for
the same angular displacement of the crankshaft relative to top dead center. A
compensated cam has one lobe for each cylinder, and these lobes are not all the
same. The difference in the lobes causes the breaker points to open when the
piston in each cylinder is the same linear distance from the top of its stroke.
compensated fuel pump. A vane-type, engine-driven fuel pump that has a
diaphragm connected to the pressure-regulating valve. The chamber above the
diaphragm is vented to the carburetor upper deck where it senses the pressure of
the air as it enters the carburetor. The diaphragm allows the fuel pump to
compensate for altitude changes and keeps the carburetor inlet fuel pressure a
constant amount higher than the carburetor inlet air pressure.
compensating cam (turbine-engine-powered helicopter control). A cam in the
engine control system of a turbine-engine-powered helicopter that coordinates
the engine power with the position of the collective-pitch control stick.
compensating relief valve (reciprocating engine lubrication system component).
A type of oil pressure relief valve used in some of the larger aircraft engines.
When the oil is cold, two springs hold the pressure relief valve on its seat. But
when the oil warms up, a thermostatic valve directs oil against a piston in the
relief valve. This oil disables one spring and allows the oil pressure to be
controlled by only one spring. The initial high oil pressure forces the thick, cold
oil through the engine and assures that all the bearings are lubricated when the
oil is cold.
compensating winding (electrical generator). A series winding in a compoundwound DC generator. The coils of the compensating winding are embedded in
the faces of the field poles, and their magnetic fields assist the fields from the
interpoles to effectively cancel the field distortion caused by armature current.
compensator port (aircraft brake master cylinder component). A small hole
between a hydraulic brake master cylinder and the reservoir. The first movement
of the piston in the master cylinder covers the compensating port and traps fluid

between the master cylinder piston and the brake wheel cylinders to apply the
brakes. When the brake is released, the piston uncovers the compensator port,
and if any fluid has been lost from the brake, the reservoir will refill the master
cylinder. A restricted compensator port may cause the brakes to drag or slow
their release.
compiler (computer programming). A program that converts a high-level
language that is easy for a programmer to use into machine language that can be
used by the computer.
complacency (human factors). Overconfidence due to repeated experience in a
specific activity, complacency has been implicated as a contributing factor in
numerous aviation accidents and incidents. Like fatigue, complacency reduces
the pilot’s effectiveness in the flight deck, but is harder to recognize than fatigue
since the pilot perceives that all is progressing smoothly.
complementary angles. The complement of an angle is 90° minus the angle. For
example, 30° is the complement of 60°: 90° – 60° = 30°. An angle of 30° and an
angle of 60° are complementary angles; their sum is 90°. The two acute angles in
a right triangle are always complementary angles.

carbon and an insulating material. The mixture is molded inside a protective
insulation with a wire lead extending radially from each end. The ohmic value of

the resistor is determined by the percentage of insulating material in the mixture,

compression ignition engine. A form of reciprocating engine which uses heat
produced by compressing the air in the cylinder to ignite the fuel. A diesel
engine is a compression-ignition engine. The piston, moving upward in the
cylinder, compresses and heats the air. When the piston is near the top of its
stroke, fuel is sprayed into the hot air, and it ignites and burns.
compression molding (plastics manufacturing process). A method of molding
thermosetting resins. A mold is opened and heated, and resin is put in it. The

spars put there by the tensile loads from the drag and anti-drag wires.
compression test (reciprocating engine maintenance test). A maintenance test
performed on a reciprocating engine to determine the ability of the cylinders to
hold air pressure. A cylinder will fail a compression test if an excessive amount
of air leaks past the piston rings, or if any air leaks past the intake or exhaust
valve.
compression tester (differential). A maintenance tool used to determine the
functional condition of a reciprocating engine cylinder. A regulated air pressure
of 80 psi is directed into the cylinder through a calibrated orifice, and the
pressure is measured on both sides of the orifice. The difference between the
indications on the two gages is the pressure drop across the orifice. This drop is
caused by air leaking past the piston rings or the valves. Typically, a cylinder
should hold 75% of the air pressure applied to it. Therefore the cylinder pressure
gage should read at least 60 psi when the input pressure gage reads 80 psi.

the surface of an airfoil moving through the air at a speed greater than the speed
of sound.

blades to convert the velocity energy into pressure.
compressor stall (gas turbine engine operating condition). A condition in a
turbine engine axial-flow compressor in which the angle of attack of one or more
blades becomes excessive and the smooth airflow through the compressor is
disrupted. When only a few blades stall, the effect is minimal and is noticed by a
fluttering or rumbling sound. When the entire compressor disk stalls, the effect
can be a serious slowing down of the air through the engine. This can result in a
loud explosive noise with a resulting RPM fluctuation and a serious increase in
exhaust gas temperature. A compressor stall can occur if the airflow through the
engine is restricted while the compressor RPM is high.

engine operating curve which shows the relationship between the compression
ratio of the engine and the mass airflow that must be maintained through the
engine.

blade angle increases the air load on the propeller, and the engine slows down. If
the RPM drops below that for which the governor is set, the propeller pitch will
decrease, and the decreased air load allows the engine to speed back up to its onspeed condition.
constant-voltage charge (batteries). A method of charging aircraft batteries in
which a constant voltage is placed across the battery while it is being charged.
When a battery is discharged, its voltage is low and the charging current is high.
But as the battery becomes charged, its voltage rises and the charging current
decreases. When the battery voltage is the same as the voltage of the charging
source, no more charging current flows. Aircraft generators charge the batteries
with a constant-voltage charge.

that, by reflecting on experiences, students construct their own understanding of
the environment.
contact (engine starting command). The term used between a person handpropping an aircraft engine and the person in the cockpit. When the person is
ready to spin the propeller, he or she calls “contact.” The person in the cockpit
turns on the fuel, slightly opens the throttle, applies the brakes, and replies

“contact,” and then turns the ignition switch to BOTH. The propeller is then
pulled through to start the engine.
contact approach (air traffic control). An approach in which an aircraft on an IFR
flight plan, having an air traffic control authorization, operating clear of clouds
with at least one mile flight visibility and a reasonable expectation of continuing
to the destination airport in those conditions, may deviate from the instrument
approach procedure and proceed to the destination airport by visual reference to
the surface.
contact cement. A type of adhesive that is spread on both surfaces to be joined
and allowed to dry. The dried contact cement is not sticky to touch, but when the

ground beneath it.
contact flying. Flight in which the attitude of the aircraft is maintained and its
navigation is done by visual reference to the horizon and to the ground over
which the aircraft is flying.
contactor (electrical control device). A heavy-duty, remotely operated switch
used to control electrical circuits carrying large amounts of current.
contaminant. An impurity that pollutes. Dirt and water are contaminants that
pollute aircraft fuel.

whenever standing water, ice, snow, slush, frost in any form, heavy rubber, or
other substances are present. A runway is contaminated with respect to rubber
deposits or other friction-degrading substances when the average friction value
for any 500-foot segment of the runway within the available landing distance
falls below the recommended minimum friction level, and the average friction
value in the adjacent 500-foot segment falls below the maintenance planning
friction level.

followed by another word or words to clarify what is expected of the pilot. For
example: “continue taxi,” “continue descent,” or “continue inbound”.
continuity (electrical circuit condition). A condition in which something is
complete or unbroken. An electrical circuit is said to have continuity when
current can flow from one end of the circuit to the other.
continuity light (electrical test equipment). A simple piece of test equipment
used to check an electrical circuit for continuity. A continuity light consists of a
flashlight battery and a bulb, connected in series with test leads used to complete
the circuit. The test leads are connected to the ends of an electrical circuit. If the
circuit is continuous (there are no breaks, or opens, in the circuit) the light will
illuminate. If the circuit is not continuous (there is an open, or a break, in it), the
light will not illuminate. Continuity lights are sometimes called bug lights
because they are used to find the “bugs” in a circuit. More elaborate continuity
testers have buzzers in addition to the light. The buzzer allows a circuit to be
checked without having to watch the tester.
continuity tester. A troubleshooting tool that consists of a battery, a light bulb,
and test leads. The test leads are connected to each end of the conductor under
test, and if the bulb lights up, there is continuity. If it does not light up, the
conductor is open.

maintenance program that complies with Part 121 and 135 operations, and with
the fractional ownership operations as outlined in 14 CFR Part 91 (Subpart K).
CAMP is an FAA-approved program and is run in a manner similar to
progressive inspections for general aviation aircraft, but is regulated in a way
specifically tailored to for-hire aviation operations.

machine which specifies the amount of electrical load the machine can carry for
an indefinite period of time.
continuous-duty solenoid. A solenoid-type switch designed to be kept energized
by current flowing through its coil for an indefinite period of time. The battery

flows through its coil all of the time the battery is connected to the electrical
system.
continuous-element fire detection system. A fire and overheat detection system
in which a gas-releasing element and a pressure switch are sealed in a stainless
steel tube installed so it surrounds the compartment being protected. If the tube
is exposed to a fire or an overheat condition, the element releases gas and closes
the pressure switch. This actuates the fire warning system.

continuous filament (composites). A single, flexible, small-diameter fiber of
indefinite length.
continuous-flow oxygen system. A system of aviation breathing oxygen in
which a metered amount of oxygen flows continuously into the mask. A
rebreather-type mask is used with a continuous-flow system. The simplest form
of continuous-flow oxygen systems regulates the flow by a calibrated orifice in
the outlet to the mask, but most systems use either a manual or automatic
regulator to vary the pressure across the orifice proportional to the altitude being
flown.
continuous gusset (wing rib bracing). A brace made of thin plywood used to
reinforce the glue joints of all the upright and diagonal braces used in a wooden
wing rib. The continuous gusset runs the full length of the rib, rather than being
made in the form of small separate gussets at each joint.
continuous ignition system (turbine ignition system). An ignition system that can
be turned on and used continuously when the need arises.
continuous-loop fire detection system. A type of fire detection system which
uses two conductors, separated by a thermistor material, formed into a
continuous loop that surrounds the area being protected. A thermistor is an
electrical insulator at normal temperature, but becomes a conductor when heated.
When a fire occurs, the thermistor conducts electricity and completes the fire
warning circuit. This turns on the fire warning light and starts the fire warning
horn or bell.

exhausts condense and freeze into tiny ice crystals. These crystals reflect light
from the sun and form the visible track across the sky.
contrarotating. Rotating in opposite directions.

contrarotating propellers. Two propellers mounted on concentric shafts and
turning in opposite directions. The two propellers are driven by either a single
engine or two engines coupled together, and their opposite rotation counteracts
the effect of torque caused by the engines driving the propellers.

§71.163), control area extensions (14 CFR §71.165), and area low routes.
Control areas do not include the continental control area, but unless otherwise
designated, they do include the airspace between a segment of a main VOR
Federal Airway and its associated alternate segments, with the vertical extent of
the area corresponding to the vertical extent of the related segment of the main
airway.
control cable (aircraft control system component). A steel cable used to connect
the cockpit control to the flight control surfaces of an aircraft. See aircraft
control cable.
control circuit (electrical circuit). An electrical circuit used to control other
circuits in an electrical device or system. Control circuits include sensors and
measuring devices. The output current in a control circuit is low, usually just
enough to actuate the devices that control the main load current of the device or
system.
control column (airplane control system). The control in the cockpit of an
airplane on which the control wheel is mounted. Rotation of the control wheel
operates the ailerons, and back-and-forth movement of the control column
moves the elevators up or down.
Control Display Unit. See CDU.

signal to be amplified is applied. The voltage on the control grid controls the

amount of electron flow allowed between the cathode and the anode, or plate, of
the tube.

to which the control cable or push-pull rod attaches to move the surface.
controllability. The characteristic of an aircraft that allows it to change its flight
attitude in response to the pilot’s movement of the cockpit controls.
controllable-pitch propeller (aircraft propeller). A propeller whose blade pitch
angle can be changed in flight. Takeoff is made with a low blade angle (low
pitch) that allows the engine to develop its maximum power. When the airplane
is set up for cruise flight, the pitch of the blades is increased so the propeller
advances farther through the air each revolution of the engine. This allows the
engine to operate at a slower, more economical speed. A controllable-pitch
propeller and a constant-speed propeller are similar, the main difference being
the control. The pitch of a constant-speed propeller is controlled by a governor,
and the pitch of a controllable-pitch propeller is controlled by a manually
actuated valve or switch.
controlled airport. An airport that has an operating control tower.
controlled airspace (air traffic control). Airspace designated as a continental
control area, control area, control zone, terminal control area, transition area, or
positive control area within which some or all aircraft may be subject to air
traffic control.

control service is provided to IFR flights and to VFR flights in accordance with
the airspace classification. Note: Controlled airspace is a generic term that
covers Class A, Class B, Class C, Class D, and Class E airspace.”
controlled departure time programs (air traffic control). The flow control process
in which aircraft are held on the ground at the departure airport when delays are
projected to occur in either the en route system or the terminal of intended

congestion in the air traffic system or to limit the duration of airborne holding in
the arrival center or terminal area. A CDT is a specific departure slot shown on
the flight plan as an expected departure clearance time (EDCT).
controlled diffusion compressor blade (turbine engine compressor blade). A
design of compressor blade used in some of the modern axial-flow gas turbine

engines. The leading edge is thicker than that of the conventional circular arc

separation of the air over their surface. The thicker leading edges erode far less
than the leading edges of circular arc blades.
controlled firing areas. Special use airspace wherein activities are conducted
under conditions so controlled as to eliminate hazards to nonparticipating aircraft
and to ensure the safety of persons and property on the ground.
controlled flight into terrain (CFIT). A situation where a mechanically normally
functioning airplane is inadvertently flown into the ground, water, or an obstacle.
There are two basic causes of CFIT accidents; both involve flight crew
situational awareness. One definition of situational awareness is an accurate
perception by pilots of the factors and conditions currently affecting the safe
operation of the aircraft and the crew. The causes of CFIT are the flight crews’
lack of vertical position awareness or their lack of horizontal position awareness
in relation to terrain and obstacles.
controlled time of arrival (air traffic control). The original estimated time of
arrival adjusted by the air traffic control system command center ground delay
factor.
control locking device (aircraft control system). A device used to lock the flightcontrol surfaces of an aircraft in their neutral position when the aircraft is on the
ground. Control locking devices normally have some type of warning flag to
direct attention to the fact that they are installed or engaged. This prevents their
being left in place when the aircraft is readied for flight.
control panel. The panel in an aircraft cockpit that contains the flight and engine
instruments and switches for the operation of the aircraft systems.

aluminum alloy tubing used to actuate flight controls from the cockpit. Control
rods are often called push-pull rods because of the method of their actuation.
control rod (nuclear reactor). A rod used to control the amount of activity in a
nuclear reactor. It may be a fuel rod or a neutron-absorbing rod.
control sector (air traffic control). An airspace area of defined horizontal and
vertical dimensions for which a controller or group of controllers has air traffic
control responsibility, normally within an air route traffic control center or an
approach control facility.
control slash (air traffic control). A radar beacon slash representing the actual
position of the associated aircraft. Normally, the control slash is the one closest
to the interrogating radar beacon site. When ARTCC radar is operating in the
narrow-band (digitized) mode, the control slash is converted to a target symbol.

hydraulically boosted aircraft control system that cushions the movement of a
control at the end of its travel.
control station (CS) (UAS operations). An interface used by the remote pilot or
the person manipulating the controls to guide the flight path of a small
unmanned aircraft.
control stick (aircraft control system component). A vertical stick in the cockpit
of an airplane with which the pilot operates the ailerons and elevators. Side-toside movement of the stick moves the ailerons, and back-and-forth movement
moves the elevators. Most modern airplanes use control wheels, rather than
control sticks.
control surface (airplane flight controls). Aerodynamic surfaces which can be
moved from the cockpit of an airplane to cause the airplane to rotate about its
three axes. The primary control surfaces are the ailerons, elevators, and rudder.
control touch. The ability to sense the action of the airplane and its probable
actions in the immediate future, with regard to attitude and speed variations, by

sensing and evaluating varying pressures and resistance of the control surfaces
transmitted through the cockpit flight controls.
control tower. A terminal facility that uses air/ground communications, visual
signaling, and other devices to provide ATC services to aircraft operating in the
vicinity of an airport or on the movement area. Authorizes aircraft to land or take
off at the airport controlled by the tower or to transit the Class D airspace area
regardless of the flight plan or weather conditions. May also provide radar or
non-radar approach control services.
control wheel (aircraft control system component). A wheel-like control in an
airplane cockpit used by the pilot to move the ailerons and elevators. Rotation of
the wheel moves the ailerons, and back-and-forth or in-and-out movement
moves the elevators. Because the wheel does not rotate in a complete circle,
most aircraft control wheels are not round, but are, rather, only segments of a
wheel.
control yoke. The movable column on which an airplane control wheel is
mounted. The yoke may be moved in or out to actuate the elevators, and the
control wheel may be rotated to actuate the ailerons.
control zone (air traffic control). Controlled airspace which extends upward from
the surface and terminates at the base of the continental control area. Control
zones that do not underlie the continental control area have no upper limit. A
control zone may include one or more airports. It is normally a circular area with
a radius of five statute miles from the center of the airport and may include any
extensions necessary for instrument approach and departure paths.
control zone (ICAO). A controlled airspace extending upwards from the surface
of the earth to a specified upper limit.
convection (meteorology). Predominantly vertical movement of the atmosphere
that results in mixing the atmospheric properties. Convection differs from
advection, which is the horizontal movement of the atmosphere.
convection (heat transfer). A method of heat transfer within a fluid by means of
vertical currents. Heat is absorbed in the bottom layer of the fluid by conduction,
and this heat decreases the density of the fluid. The less dense fluid rises and
forces the cooler, more dense fluid down.

convection cooling (electronic equipment cooling). Heat released from
electronic equipment warms the air surrounding it. The warm air rises and
escapes from the housing through outlet openings. Cooler air is drawn into the
housing through the inlet openings replaces the warm air.
convection current. The vertical movement of molecules of a fluid in a container
that is being heated. The warmed fluid rises and forces the cold fluid down.
convective cloud (meteorology). See cumuliform.
convective condensation level (meteorology). The lowest level at which
condensation will occur as a result of convection due to surface heating. When
condensation occurs at this level, the layer between the surface and the CCL will
be thoroughly mixed, the temperature lapse rate will be dry adiabatic, and the
mixing ratio will be constant.
convective instability (meteorology). The state of an unsaturated layer of air
whose lapse rates of temperature and moisture are such that, when the air is
lifted adiabatically until the layer becomes saturated, spontaneous convection
will occur.
convective lifting (meteorology). Vertical movement of heated air. When a
parcel of air is heated, it becomes less dense and begins to rise above the cooler,
denser air surrounding it.

go from the positive terminal of an electrical source to its negative terminal. The
actual movement within an electrical circuit is that of electrons and is called
electron current. The arrowhead in a semiconductor diode symbol points in the

direction of conventional current, while electron current moves in the opposite
direction.

conventional landing gear (airplane landing gear). The type of airplane landing
gear with the main wheels ahead of the center of gravity and a small wheel
supporting the tail when the airplane is on the ground. A conventional landing
gear requires a great deal of pilot skill to keep the airplane from ground looping
(accidentally turning around) when it is moving at a fast speed on the ground.
The other type of landing gear, which is now the most commonly used, is the
tricycle landing gear. The two main wheels are behind the center of gravity, and
the auxiliary wheel supports the aircraft nose.

conventional tail (empennage configuration). An airplane tail design with the
horizontal stabilizer mounted at the bottom of the vertical stabilizer. This is
correctly called an inverted cruciform tail. Other types of empennage are: T-tail,
with the horizontal stabilizer above the vertical surface, and V-tail, in which two
surfaces forming a V provide both longitudinal and vertical stability and control.
converge. To draw closer together and eventually to meet. Converging lines are
lines which, if continued, will meet and cross one another.

convergence (meteorology). The condition that exists when the distribution of
winds within a given area is such that there is a net horizontal inflow of air into
the area. In convergence at lower levels, the removal of the resulting excess air is
accomplished by upward movement. Clouds and precipitation are likely to occur
in areas of low-level convergent winds.
convergence zone (meteorology). A geographical area over which two air
masses move back and forth. Weather conditions in a convergence zone can
drastically change from moment to moment as fronts form and dissipate.
convergent-divergent duct. A duct that has a decreasing cross section in the
direction of flow (convergent) until a minimum area is reached. After this point,
the cross section increases, or becomes divergent. Convergent-divergent ducts
are called CD ducts, or in the United Kingdom, con-di ducts.

convergent-divergent exhaust duct (gas turbine engine exhaust duct). An exhaust
duct used on the engine of a supersonic aircraft. The cross-sectional area of the
duct decreases in the direction of the gas flow until it is small enough that the
gases passing through this area travel at the speed of sound. Beyond this point of
minimum area, the duct enlarges so the gases can be further speeded up above
the speed of sound.
convergent-divergent inlet duct (supersonic airplane component). A form of
duct, or passage, used for the inlet air to supersonic airplane engines. The
forward section of the duct is convergent (it becomes smaller in the direction of
the airflow). The air entering the duct at a supersonic speed is slowed to a speed
of Mach one by a shock wave in the narrowest part of the duct. Beyond this
point, the area of the duct increases—becomes divergent. The air, now traveling
slower than the speed of sound, is further slowed, and its pressure increases.
convergent duct. A duct, or passage, whose cross-sectional area decreases in the
direction of fluid flow.

conversion coating (aircraft finishing system component). A chemical solution
used to form an airtight oxide or phosphate film on the surface of aluminum or
magnesium parts. The conversion coating prevents air reaching the metal and
keeps it from corroding.
convertaplane (aircraft design). A type of heavier-than-air aircraft able to rise
and descend vertically. The convertaplane rises vertically by using rotors similar
to those on a helicopter. But, when it is in the air, the rotors can be tilted forward
to produce thrust to pull the convertaplane through the air as a fixed-wing
aircraft.
converter (electrical machine). A rotating electrical machine that changes, or
converts, alternating current into direct current. A converter is usually a form of
motor-generator, in which an AC motor drives a DC generator.

of ethylene glycol and water is normally used as a coolant in liquid-cooled
aircraft engines.
cooling fins. Thin ribs that extend outward from a surface to carry heat from the
surface into the air flowing through the fins.
The cylinders of air-cooled aircraft engines are finned to increase their surface
area, so a maximum amount of heat can be transferred from the cylinder into the

air.
cooling vent. A vent in the side or top of the balloon envelope that opens to
release hot air and automatically closes after the release of air.
cooperative aircraft. An aircraft that is being tracked by air traffic control (ATC)
or an aircraft that has an electronic means of identification (i.e., a transponder)
aboard.

aircraft, but is not in command of the aircraft.

coping saw. A small, wood-cutting handsaw that uses a replaceable blade only
about 1 ⁄8-inch wide. The blade is held under tension in the jaws of a U-shaped
frame that has a handle in line with the blade. Coping saws are used to cut
curves in thin wood.
copper. A ductile, malleable, reddish-brown, metallic chemical element.
Copper’s symbol is Cu, its atomic number is 29, and its atomic weight is 63.546.
Copper is one of our most important nonferrous metals. It is heavy, ductile, and
malleable and has excellent electrical and thermal conductivity. Copper is used
as a pure metal and as an alloy for other metals. One of copper’s widest uses is
in the manufacture of electrical wire.
copper brazing. A method of brazing in which copper is used as the filler metal.
Steel parts to be brazed are put together with as little space as possible between
them. Copper is melted along the edges of the steel parts, and as the molten
copper wets the steel, capillary action pulls the molten copper between the steel
parts. When the copper cools, it solidifies and forms a tight bond between the
steel parts.
copper-constantan thermocouple. A thermocouple combination used to measure
temperatures up to about 300°C. Copper forms the positive element, and
constantan, the negative.
copper crush gasket. A copper gasket used to form a leakproof seal between
components that operate at a high temperature. The gasket is made of a hollow
copper ring formed around a ring of asbestos. When the component to be sealed
is tightened down on the gasket, the asbestos compresses, and the surfaces press
into the soft copper and form a leakproof seal.
copper loss (electrical loss). Energy loss caused by heat produced when current
flows through the windings of an electric motor.
copper-oxide rectifier (electrical component). A rectifier that allows electrons to
pass in one direction, but opposes their flow in the opposite direction. An oxide
film is formed on a disk of copper, and a disk of lead is pressed tightly against
the oxide. A barrier exists between the copper and the copper oxide that allows
electrons to pass from the copper through the oxide to the lead; but they cannot
pass from the lead through the oxide and the barrier to the copper.
copperweld (electrical wire). A high-strength electrical conductor made by
plating a steel wire with copper. Copperweld is used for high-voltage

transmission line, and for certain types of radio antenna where high strength is
more important than maximum conductivity.
cord body (tire construction). Diagonal layers of rubber-coated nylon cord fabric
oriented at opposite angles to each other. These plies provide the strength of a
tire.
core (composites). The central component of a composite sandwich to which the
face plies or skins are bonded.

engine. The core engine consists of the portion of the compressor used to supply
air for the operation of the engine, the diffuser, the combustors, the turbine
nozzle, and the stages of the turbine used to drive the compressor. The core
engine provides the high-velocity gas used to drive the fan and any free turbines
that provide power for propellers, rotors, pumps, or generators.

composite sandwich.
Coriolis effect (helicopter rotor condition). The change in rotor blade velocity to
compensate for a change in the distance between the center of mass of the rotor
blade and the axis of rotation of the blade as the blades flap in flight.

Coriolis force (meteorology). A force which acts on a particle while it is moving
along a path in a plane that is being rotated. For example, when wind blows
along a path over the surface of the earth from the poles toward the equator, the
rotation of the earth causes the wind to deflect to the right in the northern
hemisphere and to the left in the southern hemisphere. It is the Coriolis force that
causes the circular movement of the winds. It is also the Coriolis force that
causes water to swirl in a spiral as it drains out the bottom of a bowl.
Coriolis illusion. The illusion of rotation or movement in an entirely different

vibration, overloading, or internal stresses.
crack arrester (aircraft structure). A small hole drilled in the end of a crack to
prevent the crack continuing. Drilling this hole is called stop-drilling the crack.
A crack in a piece of metal will continue to grow as long as the stresses
concentrated at the end of the crack are greater than the tensile strength of the
metal. A hole drilled at the end of a crack spreads these stresses out over the

entire circumference of the hole, rather than allowing them to concentrate at the
extremely small area of the end of the crack.

airplane or the rotor system transmission of a helicopter is driven by the
crankshaft.
crankshaft runout (reciprocating engine dimension). The amount a crankshaft is
bent. Runout is checked by supporting the crankshaft in V-blocks or rollers and

information—basically, all groups routinely working with the cockpit crew who
are involved in decisions required to operate a flight safely. These groups
include, but are not limited to: pilots, dispatchers, cabin crewmembers,
maintenance personnel, and air traffic controllers. CRM is one way of
addressing the challenge of optimizing the human/machine interface and
accompanying interpersonal activities.

when a maximum crossing altitude at a specific fix is required. It does not
prohibit the aircraft from crossing the fix at a lower altitude; however, the
aircraft must be at or above the minimum IFR altitude.
cross-flow valve (landing gear system component). An automatic flow-control
valve installed between the gear-up and gear-down lines of the landing gear of
some large airplanes. When the landing gear is released from its uplocks, its
weight causes it to fall faster than the hydraulic system can supply fluid to the

mechanical pressure or vibrations into electrical signals. When a piezoelectric
crystal is physically distorted, a potential difference is created across its faces.
Crystal transducers are also called piezoelectric transducers.
CSD (constant-speed drive). A component used with either aircraft gas turbine
or reciprocating engines to drive AC generators. The speed of the output shaft of

Current flowing through the coil produces a magnetic field that reacts with the
field of the permanent magnet, and the coil rotates against the opposition of the
hairsprings. The greater the current flowing through the coil, the stronger its
magnetic field and the farther the coil rotates. A pointer attached to the coil
moves across a scale calibrated in amps, milliamps, or microamps. D’Arsonval
meters can be connected into circuits with multiplier resistors or shunts and can
be used to measure voltage, current, or resistance.

mechanical movements. A loose-fitting piston moves back and forth in a
cylinder which contains a fluid, either liquid or air. The piston is connected to
the component whose movement is to be damped. The component can move
slowly with little opposition if the fluid is given time to move from one side of
the piston to the other, but the dashpot restrains fast movement because of the

pressure built up in the tester is applied to a cylinder fitted with a free-floating
piston. This piston has an accurately known area and is loaded with an
accurately known weight.
The amount of pressure needed to raise the piston is found by dividing the
weight being lifted by the area of the piston. This pressure is applied to the gage
being calibrated, and the gage is adjusted to read this amount.

99.9 ohms may be selected.
decalage. The difference in the angles of incidence between the two wings of a
biplane. If the upper wing has a greater angle of incidence than the lower wing,
the decalage is positive. If the lower wing has the greater angle of incidence, the
decalage is negative.
decarbonizer. A solvent used to soften carbon deposits that have formed on
metal surfaces. Carbon formed on engine parts because of the coking action of
oil is hard and is baked onto the surface of the metal. It must be softened with a
decarbonizer before it can be removed. Some decarbonizers are used cold, and
others are heated to make them act faster.

the position of the decimal point. One digit to the right of the decimal point
means that the denominator is 10 (0.1 = 1 ⁄10); two digits to the right of the
decimal shows the denominator is 100 (0.01 = 1 ⁄100), and three digits indicates
1,000 (0.001 = 1 ⁄1,000).
decimal number system. The system of numbers using ten as its base. The digits
in the decimal number system are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. In a multidigit
number, the position of the digit shows its value. Each position has a value ten
times that of the position immediately to its right. For example, the number
5,286 is the same as 5,000 (5 · 1,000) + 200 (2 · 100) + 80 (8 · 10) + 6 (6 · 1).
decimal point. A dot which separates a whole number from its decimal fraction.

shorted condition for a specified period of time. Then, the battery is recharged to
140% of its ampere hour capacity.
deep discharge (batteries). A maintenance procedure for discharging a battery
that removes all the electrical energy from the battery before it is recharged.
When a battery is deep discharged, it is discharged at a specified rate until its

connected with shorting straps and left shorted for a specified period of time.
Deep discharging puts all the cells in a battery in the same condition, ready to
receive a new charge.
deepening (meteorology). A decrease in the central pressure of a pressure
system. This term is usually applied to a low rather than to a high, but
technically it is acceptable in either case.

onto the valve, depresses the valve stem and allows the air to safely escape
through a hole in the side of the cap.
deflecting-beam torque wrench (precision hand tool). A calibrated wrench which
indicates the amount of torque being applied to a nut or bolt. This is done by
measuring the amount the beam of the wrench deflects when the torque is being
applied.
According to Hooke’s law of elasticity, the beam will deflect the same amount
each time a given amount of torque is applied by the wrench. The indication of
the amount of torque is read by the position of a pointer attached to the drive of
the wrench, over a fixed scale fastened to the beam of the wrench.

circuit distortion, and improves the frequency response of the circuit.
degradation (of a structural material or part). The alteration of the material
properties in alloys, composites, or other manufactured aircraft parts or
structures, which may result from environmental exposure, deviations in
manufacturing, or from repeated loading or thermal pressures. Deterioration
such as this can affect properties such as a material’s strength, modulus (the
stiffness to density ratio), or coefficient of expansion (or, the amount a material
is expected to expand or change dimension, upon exposure).
degreaser. A chemical solution used to remove oil and grease from a part.
Stoddard solvent and naphtha are two popular degreasers used in aircraft
maintenance shops.
dehumidify. To decrease the amount of moisture (water vapor) in the air.
Dehumidifying is often done by installing a small cooling system in the room to
cause moisture to condense on its coils. Water vapor is removed from the air and
changed into liquid water.
dehydrator. A material that removes some of the moisture from the air inside a
component. Some dehydrators use silica gel to absorb the moisture. The silica
gel crystals may be colored with an indicator dye that changes its color from
blue to pink when the crystals absorb moisture.
dehydrator plug (reciprocating engine preservative device). A transparent plastic
tube filled with a desiccant agent, such as silica gel, and an indicator, such as
cobalt chloride. One end of the tube is sealed, and the other end is fitted with a
perforated plug and threaded so that it can be screwed into a spark plug hole.

When the air inside the cylinder is dry, the indicator dye is blue, but if moisture
gets into the cylinder, it is absorbed by the silica gel, and the indicator changes
its color to pink.
deice. The act of removing ice accumulation from an aircraft structure.
deicer. A system or component used to remove ice from a surface. Deicers must
not be confused with anti-icers, which prevent the formation of ice. Deicers
remove ice after it has formed.
deicer boots (aircraft deicing component). Inflatable rubber boots attached to the
leading edges of the wings and empennage of an airplane. Compressed air is
pumped into tubes in the boots to inflate them in a timed sequence. Ice is
allowed to form over these boots while they are deflated, and when they inflate,
they break the ice from the surface, and the airflow carries it away.
deicing fluid. A fluid that is heated and sprayed onto an aircraft being prepared
for takeoff in conditions of freezing temperature and snow. Most deicing fluids
contain a form of glycol, with thickeners added to hold the glycol to the surface.
These fluids remove the ice and then stick to the surface and prevent the
formation of more ice.
degrees of freedom (DOF). The defined modes in which a mechanical device or
system can move. The number of degrees of freedom is equal to the total number
of independent displacements or aspects of motion. For example, attitude
degrees of freedom for an airplane is equal to three degrees of freedom (3-DOF)
—pitch, roll, and yaw.

used before such terms as meter (dekameter, or decameter) or liter (dekaliter, or
decaliter).
delamination. A separation of the layers of a laminated material. Plywood is
made up of layers, or laminations, of wood glued together. When the glue
weakens, the layers can separate and the plywood is said to be delaminated.
Delamination of bonded composite materials causes the materials to lose
strength.
delay assignment (DAS) (air traffic control). A type of hold instruction to
aircraft pilots or dispatchers from ATC, mostly for takeoffs but also used for
landings, based on logistics in the ATC traffic management computer program.

ATC assigns delays to aircraft according to the program’s parameters, calculated
in 15-minute increments. DAS information appears as a table in the traffic flow
management system (TFMS).
“Delay indefinite [reason, if known] expect further clearance [time]” (air traffic
control). A phrase used by ATC to inform a pilot when an accurate estimate of
the delay time and the reason for the delay cannot immediately be determined.
Such delays could be a disabled aircraft on the runway, terminal or center area
saturation, or weather below landing minimums.
delay time (air traffic control). The amount of time an arriving aircraft must lose
to cross the meter fix at the assigned meter fix time. This is the difference
between actual calculated landing time (ACLT) and the vertex time of arrival
(VTA).

delta connection (electrical wiring connection). A type of connection used for
three-phase alternating-current generators, motors, and transformers. Two of the
phase windings are in series, across the third phase winding.
The term delta connection comes from the symbol for this type of connection,
which is drawn in such a way that it shows the windings arranged in the form of
a triangle, or delta. The current flowing between any two leads in a deltaconnected circuit is 1.73 times the current flowing in any single winding.

delta hinge (helicopter rotor hinge). A hinge at the root of a helicopter rotor
blade. The axis of the delta hinge lies in the plane of rotation of the blade, and
allows the blade to flap up or down to equalize the lift produced by the rotor
system as the helicopter moves through the air.
delta iron. The molecular arrangement in iron at temperatures between 1,392°C
and 1,538°C. Pure iron melts at 1,538°C.
∆ P (delta P). Differential pressure.
delta wing (airplane wing configuration). A wing having a triangular shape—an
extreme amount of sweepback on the leading edge and a trailing edge that is
almost perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the airplane. Delta wings are
used on some supersonic airplanes.
demagnetize. To remove the magnetism from a piece of magnetized material.
When a piece of material is magnetized, all the magnetic domains are aligned, or
oriented in the same direction. When it is demagnetized, the magnetic domains
are knocked out of alignment, and their magnetic fields cancel so there is no
overall magnetic field.
demand oxygen system (breathing oxygen system). An oxygen system installed
in an aircraft and used by the flight crew when flying at high altitude. The
demand system meters oxygen from the regulator to the mask only when the
user inhales, and the flow of oxygen is shut off during exhale. A demand oxygen
system is much more economical of the oxygen supply than a continuous-flow
system.
demodulate (telecommunications). To remove the modulation from a
telecommunicated signal. When computer data is transmitted by
telecommunications, it is changed into audible tones, or modulated, so it will

pass it over the telephone lines. At the receiving computer, the data is
demodulated (the modulation is removed), and the data is changed back into its
digital form.
demodulation (radio signal). The production inside a radio receiver of an audiofrequency AC signal that follows the modulation on a radio-frequency carrier.
Audio-frequency information or music is used to change the amplitude or
frequency of the RF carrier wave in the radio transmitter. When the modulated
carrier is picked up by the receiver, it is demodulated. Changes in the amplitude
or frequency of the carrier produce an audio-frequency AC that follows these
changes.

instructor first shows the student the correct way to perform an activity and then
has the student attempt the same activity.
demonstration stalls (flight instruction maneuver). A stall that a flight instructor
should demonstrate for a student pilot to instruct them how to avoid the situation

The denominator shows the number of parts the whole unit is divided into. In the

common fraction 9 ⁄16, the denominator is 16. The whole unit is divided into 16
equal parts, and this fraction uses only nine of them.

amount of mass in a cubic foot, cubic inch, or cubic centimeter. Density is
usually expressed in such units as pounds per cubic foot or grams per cubic
centimeter.
density altitude. The altitude in standard air at which the density is the same as
that of the existing air. Density altitude is found by using a computer or chart to
correct pressure altitude for nonstandard air temperature. Density altitude is used
for computing the performance of an aircraft and its engines.
density ratio (σ). The ratio of the density of the air at a given altitude to the
density of the air at sea level under standard conditions.

very small. But when the junction is reverse-biased, the depletion area is large.

depolarization (electrochemical cell condition). Removal of the hydrogen gas
which forms on the positive material inside an electrochemical cell by absorbing
it into one of the materials mixed with the electrolyte. If the cell is not
depolarized, the hydrogen gas will form an insulation on the positive material
and increase the internal resistance of the cell.
deposition. See sublimation.
depreservation. The clean up and inspection of an aircraft part when it is to be
put into service after it has been prepared for storage.
depression (meteorology). An area of low pressure, also called a low, or a
trough. The term depression is usually applied to a certain stage in the
development of a tropical cyclone, but it also applies to migratory lows and
troughs and to upper-level lows and troughs that are only weakly developed.
depth gage. An instrument used to measure the depth of a hole or groove. The
measuring scale protrudes from the center of a flat blade. The blade is laid across
the top of the hole or groove, and the measuring scale is pushed to the bottom.
The amount the scale sticks out of the blade is the depth of the hole or groove.
Depth gages are used to measure the depth of the tread on aircraft tires.
depth micrometer. A precision measuring instrument which uses a standard
micrometer caliper head mounted in a flat-ground bar. The distance the spindle
sticks out of the bar is read in thousandths of an inch. Depth micrometers are
used to measure the depth of machined grooves.
derate. To reduce the power output allowed for an engine or the voltage or
current allowed for an electrical component. Derating is done to extend the life
or reliability of a device. Newly designed aircraft engines are quite often placed

in service with a lower power rating than they are designed to produce—they are
derated. As operational experience is gained, the rated power is increased.
derichment (fuel metering system operation). A condition in the fuel metering
system of a large reciprocating engine in which the fuel-air mixture is leaned
out, or deriched, when antidetonation injection (ADI) fluid is injected into the
engine. If the mixture were not leaned, the addition of the ADI fluid would
enrich the mixture so much the engine could not produce its maximum power.
“descend via” (air traffic control). In ATC–pilot communications, a “descend
via” clearance instructs the pilot to follow the altitudes published on a STAR.
The pilot is not authorized to leave the last assigned altitude unless specifically
cleared to do so. If ATC amends the altitude or route to one that is different from
the published procedure, the rest of the charted descent procedure is canceled
and ATC will assign any further route, altitude, or airspeed clearances, as
necessary.
descent (aircraft flight condition). A decrease in altitude.
descent speed adjustments (air traffic control). Speed decrease calculations made
to determine an accurate vertex time of arrival (VTA). These calculations start at
the transition point and use arrival speed segments to the vertex.

process). The first part of a performance-based objective set for a student lesson
that explains the desired outcome of the instruction in concrete terms that can be
measured. See also performance-based objective.
desiccant. A material, such as silica gel, that is able to absorb moisture from the
air. When precision equipment is stored, bags of silica gel are packed with it.
The silica gel absorbs moisture from the air and prevents the moisture damaging
the equipment.
In pneumatic power systems, the high-pressure compressed air passes through
a desiccant which absorbs all the moisture in the air. If moisture were left in the
air, it would freeze when the air expands and its temperature drops.
designated examiner. A person authorized by the FAA to conduct a pilot
proficiency test or a practical test for an airman certificate or rating issued under
this part, or a person who is authorized to conduct a knowledge test.

designated intersection (navigational location). A point on the surface of the
earth over which two or more designated position lines intersect. The position
lines may be magnetic bearings from NDBs, radials from VHF/UHF aids,
centerlines of designated airways, air routes, localizers and DME distances.
designated pilot examiner (DPE). An individual designated by the FAA to
administer practical tests to pilot applicants.

load is made up of the actual load the component is expected to encounter, plus a
factor of safety.
design maneuvering speed (VA). The maximum speed for maneuvers at which
full application of the primary flight controls cannot overstress the airframe. If
during flight, rough air or severe turbulence is encountered, reduce the airspeed
to maneuvering speed or less to minimize stress on the airplane structure.
desired course. A predetermined desired course direction to be followed,
measured in degrees from true north (true desired course), or measured in
degrees from local magnetic north (magnetic desired course).
desired track (navigation). The planned or intended track between two
waypoints. It is measured in degrees from either magnetic or true north. The
instantaneous angle may change from point to point along the great circle track
between waypoints.
destructive testing. A method of testing that results in the destruction of the part
being tested. Destructive testing is normally an engineering procedure, used to
determine the ultimate strength of a device or part, and to identify its weakest
point.
detachable part. A part of a component which can be removed without damaging
the component.
detail drawing (aircraft mechanical drawing). A drawing that contains enough
information to allow a component to be fabricated.
detailed inspection. A thorough examination of an item including disassembly.
The overhaul of a component is considered to be a detailed inspection.
detail view (drawing). A view which shows only a part of an object but in
greater detail and to a larger scale than the principal view.

detector is normally used for a rectifier that changes modulated radio-frequency
alternating current into pulsating direct current whose amplitude varies in the
same way as the modulation on the original AC.
detent. A spring-loaded pin or tab that enters a hole or groove when the device to
which it is attached is in a certain position. Detents are used on fuel selector
valves to provide a positive means of identifying the position in which the valve
is fully on and fully off.
detergent. A synthetic cleaning material. A detergent is similar to soap in its
ability to emulsify oil and hold dirt and other solid or semi-solid contaminants.
Unlike soap, a detergent is composed of man-made chemicals, rather than
organic matter such as animal or vegetable fat.
detergent oil. A type of mineral oil to which metallic-ash-forming detergents
have been added. Detergent oil is not generally used in aircraft engines because
of its tendency to loosen carbon deposits from the engine parts. These loosened
deposits can plug oil passages inside the engine.
determiners (psychology). In test items, words which give a clue to the answer.
Words such as “always” and “never” are determiners in true–false questions.
Since absolutes are rare, such words usually make the statement false.
detonation (reciprocating engine condition). An explosion or uncontrolled
burning inside the cylinder of a reciprocating engine. Detonation occurs when
the pressure and temperature inside the cylinder become higher than the critical
pressure and temperature of the fuel, and may be caused by using fuel that has a
lower octane rating or performance number than is specified for the engine.
The pressure rise inside the cylinder caused by the fast-moving flame front can
heat and compress the unburned fuel-air mixture enough for it to explode, or
release its energy faster than the engine can accept it. This causes a rapid rise in
cylinder pressure, excessive cylinder head temperature, and a decrease in engine
power. Detonation is often confused with preignition but is not the same. See
preignition.
DETRESFA (distress phase) (ICAO). The code word used to designate an
emergency phase wherein there is reasonable certainty that an aircraft and its
occupants are threatened by grave and imminent danger or require immediate
assistance.

deuterium. An isotope of hydrogen which has one proton and one neutron in the
nucleus. A normal atom of hydrogen has one proton, but no neutrons in its
nucleus.
Deutsch rivet. A type of hollow-shank, high-strength blind rivet. The rivet is put
into the hole in the structure, and a tapered pin is driven into the hollow shank.
The pin expands the rivet so serrations on the outside of the shank press into the
sides of the hole and hold the rivet firmly in place.
developed width of a part (sheet metal layout). The width of the sheet metal cut
to form a part. If an angle, with legs of one inch and two inches, is to be formed
of sheet metal, the developed width of the metal will be less than three inches.
This is because the metal does not go to the mold lines of the angle, but goes
around the corner in the bend radius. The developed width of the metal is the
sum of the flats plus the bend allowance. This is less than the sum of the mold
line lengths (MLL).

developer (dye penetrant inspection). A powder used to pull a penetrating dye
out of a defect in a part being inspected by the dye-penetrant inspection method.
The part is soaked in the penetrant. Then, all the penetrant is washed from its
surface and the surface is covered with the developer. The developer pulls any
penetrant that has seeped into a defect to the surface where it shows up as a
visible mark.
deviations (flight operations). Any break from the planned flight route.
deviation (magnetic compass error). An error in the indication of a magnetic
compass, caused by local magnetic fields within the aircraft. Deviation error,

that are cooler than the air. Dew usually forms at night when the ground cools as
heat leaves it by radiation.
Dewar flask. A special container used to store liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen.
A Dewar flask has an inner and an outer container, with the space between them

ground facility using direction finding (DF) equipment. An obsolete technology
no longer used in the U.S.
DH. See decision height.
diac (semiconductor device). A semiconductor used as a triggering device for a
triac. A diac acts in much the same way as two zener diodes installed back to
back, with one forward biased and the other reverse biased. No current can flow
through the diac until the breakdown voltage of the reverse-biased diode is
reached. When this breakdown voltage is reached, the diac immediately turns on
and allows the gate current for the triac to flow.

diagonal cutting pliers. A type of wire cutters commonly used by aircraft
maintenance technicians. The short, strong jaws are ground so they cut the wire
by a chiseling action, rather than by shearing.

electrostatic force to pass much more easily, and it has a dielectric constant of 7.
The dielectric constant of the insulating material in a capacitor determines its
capacity.

normally occurs when the engine is overheated. Carbon particles inside the
cylinders become incandescent and ignite the fuel-air mixture in the cylinder and
keep the engine running.

The answer in a subtraction problem is called the difference.
differential aileron travel (airplane control system). The difference between the
upward and downward travel of an aileron. An aileron moves a greater number
of degrees upward than downward to counteract adverse yaw. The downwardmoving aileron produces both induced and parasite drag, but the upward-moving

aileron produces only parasite drag. To prevent the combined drag causing the
nose of the airplane to start to move toward the down aileron, the up aileron
travels a greater distance, producing enough additional parasite drag to
overcome the induced drag caused by the down aileron. See adverse yaw.

maintenance check used to determine the condition of the piston rings and the
valves in the cylinders of a reciprocating engine. An air pressure regulator holds
a constant pressure of 80 psi on the input side of a calibrated orifice. The output
side of the orifice is connected to the cylinder through an adapter screwed into a
spark plug hole.
Air flowing into the cylinder, to replace that which leaks past the piston rings
and valves, causes a pressure drop across the orifice. The amount of leakage is
indicated by the difference in the readings of the two pressure gages on the
tester.
The sound of leaking air heard at the carburetor air inlet indicates a leaking
intake valve. A leaking exhaust valve is indicated by the sound being heard at
the exhaust tail pipe. Worn piston rings are indicated by the sound of leaking air
being heard at the crankcase breather.
differential compression tester (reciprocating engine test equipment). Test
equipment consisting of an air pressure regulator, two pressure gages with a
calibrated restrictor orifice between them, and a shutoff valve. A regulated
pressure of 80 psi is directed into the cylinder being tested, and the pressure drop
across the orifice indicates the amount of air leaking past the piston rings or

valves. A cylinder in good condition should hold at least 75% of the air supplied
through the tester. With 80 psi on the input pressure gage, the cylinder pressure
gage should indicate at least 60 psi.

and shunt field windings. The two windings are connected in such a way that the
magnetic field produced by the shunt winding opposes the field produced by the
series winding.
differential pressure. A single pressure which is the difference between two
opposing pressures. The resultant of a 12 psi pressure opposing a 32 psi
pressure, is a 20 psi differential pressure. This is expressed as 20 psid.
differential-pressure range of aircraft cabin pressurization. The range of cabin
pressurization in which the controller maintains a constant difference between
the pressure of the air inside the structure and the pressure of the air outside the
structure. The amount of differential pressure allowed is determined by the
strength of the aircraft structure.
differential screw. A compound screw arrangement. A differential screw
changes the separation between two parts by the amount of difference in the
pitch of the two screw threads. If the coarse screw increases the space 0.050 inch
for each revolution, and the fine screw decreases the space 0.0357 inch for each
revolution, one revolution of the differential screw will increase the space by
0.0143 inch.

can be followed by allowing the movement to change the amount of resistance in
a variable resistor. This is an analog change.

converter, which changes the analog values into combinations of voltage and no
voltage (one and zero) that can be used in a digital computer.

lateral axis of an airplane and a line which passes through the center of the wing
or the horizontal stabilizer. Dihedral is used to increase the lateral stability of an
airplane.

diluent. A material used to thin, or dilute, a concentrated material without
changing its basic characteristics. A weak solution contains a large amount of
diluent. Paint thinner is a diluent used to make paint less viscous so it can be
sprayed or brushed more easily. The diluent evaporates after the paint is applied.
diluter-demand oxygen system. A popular type of breathing oxygen system in
which oxygen is metered to the mask where it is diluted with cabin air by an
airflow-metering aneroid assembly which regulates the amount of air allowed to
dilute the oxygen on the basis of cabin altitude.

As the aircraft goes to higher altitude, the amount of cabin air metered into the
oxygen is automatically decreased until at about 34,000 feet, the cabin air is
entirely shut off and the regulator sends 100% oxygen to the mask.
The oxygen and air flow to the mask only when the wearer inhales, but the
regulators have an emergency position which allows the pilot to manually
bypass the demand function and sends a continuous flow of 100% oxygen to the
mask.
dilution air (diluter-demand oxygen system). In a diluter-demand oxygen
system, oxygen is metered to the mask as a function of the altitude. Below the
altitude that requires 100% oxygen, ambient air (dilution air) is proportionally
mixed with the oxygen.

the edges of the hole down so the head of the countersunk rivet or screw will be
flush with surface of the metal.

diode (electrical component). A two-element electrical device. A diode contains

dip (magnetic compass characteristic). The angle formed between a compass
magnet aligned with the earth’s magnetic field and the horizontal plane. Dip is
caused by the vertical component of the earth’s magnetic field, and to correct for
dip, a weight is often put on one end of the magnet to keep it horizontal. This
weight is the cause of two errors found in aircraft magnetic compasses:
acceleration error and northerly turning error. See acceleration error and
northerly turning error.

dipcoating (insulation application). A method of electrically insulating the

dissolve. To become a liquid and form a mixture with another liquid. When
grains of solid sugar are put into a glass of water, the sugar dissolves. It becomes
a liquid and mixes with the water.
dissolved acetylene gas. Acetylene gas which has been dissolved, or absorbed, in
liquid acetone. Acetylene gas becomes unstable when it is held under pressure of
more than about 15 psi, but if it is dissolved in acetone, it can be safely held
under a pressure of more than 250 psi.
dissymmetry of lift (helicopter flight condition). The unequal lift produced
across the rotor disk of a helicopter moving through the air. The advancing
blade, the blade whose tip is moving in the same direction the helicopter is
flying, has a speed equal to its own speed plus the speed of the helicopter. The
retreating blade, the blade whose tip is moving in the opposite direction, is
traveling at a speed equal to its own speed less the speed of the helicopter. Since
aerodynamic lift is determined by the speed of the airfoil through the air, the
advancing blade produces more lift than the retreating blade.
Dissymmetry of lift is compensated by allowing the blades to flap. As the lift
produced by the advancing blade increases, it flaps upward, decreasing its angle
of attack, and thus its lift. As the lift produced by the retreating blade decreases,
it flaps downward, increasing both its angle of attack and the lift it produces.

ignition lead to the spark plug. Distributor blocks are made of a plastic material
having an extremely high dielectric strength.
distributor finger (magneto ignition system component). A term for a magneto
distributor rotor. The finger, or rotor, is the device inside a distributor that picks

which screws into the end of the propeller shaft on which a Hydromatic
propeller is mounted. For all normal operations of the propeller, including

amount of pitch change when they extend.
divergence (meteorology). A condition that exists when the distribution of winds
within a given area is such that there is a net horizontal flow of air outward from
the region. In divergence at lower levels, the resulting movement of air away
from the surface is compensated for by subsidence of air from aloft. The air is
heated and the relative humidity is lowered, making divergence a warming and
drying process. Low-level divergent regions are areas in which clouds and
precipitation are unlikely to form. Divergence is the opposite of convergence.

as the relative wind striking an airfoil. Two basic types of drag act on an aircraft
in flight: induced drag and parasite drag.
Induced drag is caused by the same factors that produce lift, and its amount
varies inversely as the airspeed. As the airspeed decreases, the angle of attack
must increase, and this increases the induced drag.
Parasite drag is caused by the friction of air moving over the structure, and its
amount varies directly as the airspeed. The higher the airspeed, the greater the
parasite drag.

coefficient of drag for any airfoil section increases as the angle of attack
increases.

aircraft at various airspeeds, showing the combined forces of parasite, profile,
and induced drag. Understanding the drag curve can provide valuable insight
into the various performance parameters and limitations of the aircraft. Pilots use
the information from this graph to find the maximum endurance and range of the
aircraft. The drag curve also illustrates the two regions of command: the region
of normal command, and the region of reversed command.

dragging brakes (aircraft brake malfunction). A condition in which the brakes do
not fully release when pressure is removed from the brake pedal. The brakes are

drive fit (mechanical fit). A tight fit between mating parts of a mechanism in
which one part fits inside another. In a drive fit, the hole is smaller than the part
that fits into it, and force must be used to assemble the parts. A drive fit is also
called an interference fit.

gear.
driver (electronic circuit). A piece of electronic equipment in a circuit that
supplies input power to an output circuit or device.

or fitted with a recess. A driver head makes it possible to drive the fastener with
some form of screwdriver, rather than with a wrench.
drivescrew. A form of self-tapping screw that has no screwdriver slot nor recess
in its head. Drivescrews are used to attach nameplates to an engine crankcase
and to plug holes in a tubular steel structure through which preservative oil has
been pumped. Drivescrews are installed by driving them in place with a hammer.
drizzle (meteorology). Very small droplets of water that appear to float with the
air currents while falling in an irregular path. Drizzle differs from rain, which
falls in a comparatively straight path, and fog, whose droplets remain suspended
in the air.
drogue. Any of several types of devices used to slow or stabilize a body moving
through water or air. A drogue parachute is a small parachute which can be

opened behind an airplane to slow or stabilize it in flight.
A drogue is also the funnel-shaped device on the end of an inflight refueling
hose. The drogue stabilizes the hose and allows the aircraft being refueled to
connect its probe into the fueling line.
A sea anchor, which is a canvas bucket with a small opening in its bottom, is
also a drogue. A sea anchor is used to stabilize and control the movement of a
boat or seaplane.
drone. Another name for an unmanned aircraft. See unmanned aircraft system
(UAS).
droop (turbine engine fuel control condition). A progressive decrease in RPM
with load in an engine whose speed is governed with a flyweight-type governor.
As the load is increased, the pilot valve drops down to meter more fuel. The
lower position of the valve decreases the compression of the speeder spring and
allows the flyweights to assume an onspeed position at a lower RPM.
droop compensator (helicopter turbine engine control). A linkage between the
collective pitch control and the turbine speed governor that adjusts for the
increased load the rotor places on the engine, as collective pitch is increased.
The droop compensator prevents the rotor speed decreasing as the load is
applied.
droop restraint (helicopter rotor system). A mechanical device that limits the
amount the blades of a helicopter rotor can droop when the rotor is turning at a
slow speed, and there is not enough centrifugal force to overcome the effect of
gravity on the blades.
drop cloth. A piece of canvas or plastic used to cover the floor or objects on the
floor when walls and ceilings are being painted. The drop cloth prevents paint
from dripping on areas where it should not be.
drop forging. A method of forging steel parts by forcing semi-molten metal into
a die by a heavy blow from a drop hammer. The grain structure of a drop-forged
part gives it more strength than a cast part.
drop hammer. A large metalworking machine that uses heavy matched dies to
form compound curves in sheet metal. The sheet of metal to be formed is placed
over a female die, and a heavy, matching male die is raised above it and dropped
into the female die, forming the metal into the shape of the dies. Drop hammers
are also used to forge semimolten metal in a die.

pilot to the ground crew to assist in landing or ground handling a balloon.
drop-out voltage (electrical relays). The minimum voltage needed to keep an
electrical relay energized. When the voltage drops below this value, the relay
automatically de-energizes. Electromagnetism holds the relay energized, and a
spring de-energizes it when the voltage producing the electromagnetism is below
the drop-out voltage.
dropping resistor (electric circuit). A resistor in an electrical circuit used to drop
voltage. For example, if a 12-volt light bulb is used in a 24-volt electrical
system, a dropping resistor must be installed in series with the bulb to drop 12
volts. This allows only 12 volts across the bulb.
dropsonde (meteorology). An instrument pack and radio transmitter dropped by
parachute from an aircraft to measure conditions of the atmosphere through
which it passes. This information is continuously transmitted to meteorologists

composed of the oxides produced by the reaction of oxygen in the air with the
hot metal.
drum brake. A form of friction brake used on some airplanes. A drum brake is
composed of two curved shoes which have a heat-absorbing friction material
bonded to their outer surface. These shoes are pressed outward against the inside
of a cylindrical drum that rotates with the wheel. The brake is applied by
hydraulic pressure or mechanical leverage forcing the shoes out against the
drum, and a spring pulls them away from the drum when the brake pedal or
handle is released.
dry adiabat. A line on a thermodynamic chart representing a rate of temperature
change at the dry adiabatic lapse rate.
dry adiabatic lapse rate (meteorology). The rate of decrease of temperature with

addition to, or loss of, any heat energy. The dry adiabatic lapse rate is 3°C
(5.4°F) per thousand feet.
dry adiabatic process (meteorology). (1) An adiabatic process in a hypothetical
atmosphere in which no moisture is present. (2) An adiabatic process in which
no condensation of its water vapor occurs and no liquid water is present. See
adiabatic process (meteorology).

as an atmospheric standard. Dry air weighs 0.07651 pound per cubic foot under
standard sea-level conditions of 59°F (15°C) and a barometric pressure of 14.69
pounds per square inch or 29.92 inches of mercury.
dry air pump. See dry-type air pump.
dry-bulb temperature. Temperature measured by a thermometer not affected by
the evaporation of water. Relative humidity is measured by finding the
difference between wet-bulb and dry-bulb temperature. The thermometer that
measures wet-bulb temperature has a wick around its sensitive end. This wick is
saturated with water, and air blown across it evaporates the water. The
evaporation causes the wet-bulb temperature to be lower than the dry-bulb
temperature, and the amount lower is determined by the humidity, or the amount
of water vapor in the air.

A dry cell is not totally dry. Its electrolyte is a moist paste, and it is sealed to
retain its moisture.
dry-charged battery. A lead-acid storage battery that has been fully charged by
the manufacturer. Before the battery is shipped, all the electrolyte is drained out
of it, and the cells are all sealed. Before the battery is placed in service, it is
filled with electrolyte having the proper specific gravity, and the battery is given
a freshening charge (a charge that brings its voltage up to the proper value).
dry-chemical fire extinguisher. A type of handheld fire extinguisher which uses a
dry chemical, such as sodium bicarbonate, as the extinguishing agent. The dry
chemical is normally forced out of the extinguisher by compressed nitrogen.
dry fiber (composites). A condition in which fibers are not fully encapsulated by
resin during pultrusion. See pultrusion (composites).
dry ice. Solidified carbon dioxide. Dry ice sublimates, or changes from a solid

directly into a gas, at a temperature of −110°F (−78.5°C), without passing
through the liquid state. Dry ice is used as a refrigerant and as a means of
chilling mechanical parts when they are being assembled with an interference fit.
drying oil. An oil used in paints and varnishes. The oil, usually cottonseed or
linseed oil, is mixed in the paint or varnish. When it is exposed to air, the oil
oxidizes and forms a hard, dry film.

mass. In spring and early summer over western Texas, into the Plains States, and
for some distance eastward, the dryline is a favored spawning area for squall
lines and tornadoes.
dry rot. A type of decay found in seasoned wood. Dry rot is caused by fungi in
the wood which change the normal fibers into a soft material that becomes a
powder. Wood with dry rot has no structural strength.

reservoir, or tank, that is not part of the engine. Both gas turbine and
reciprocating engines can have dry-sump lubricating systems.
dry-sump system (engine lubrication system). A type of lubrication system used
on both reciprocating and turbine engines. The oil is held in an external tank,
drawn from the tank and circulated through the engine by an engine-driven
pressure pump. After lubricating the engine, the oil drains into a integral sump
from which it is picked up and returned to the oil tank by a scavenger pump.
dry-type air pump (engine accessory). An engine-driven air pump that uses
carbon vanes, rather than steel vanes.
Dry-type pumps require no lubrication, but the vanes are extremely susceptible
to damage from solid airborne particles. These pumps must therefore be operated
with filters in their inlet.
dry wash (aircraft maintenance). A method used to remove airport film, dust,
and small accumulations of dirt and soil from an aircraft structure when the use
of liquids is neither desirable nor practical.
dual-beam oscilloscope. A cathode-ray oscilloscope with two electron beams

oscilloscopes may be used to observe the signals on the input and the output of a
portion of a circuit at the same time.

dual controls (aircraft flight controls). Two sets of fully functioning flight
controls in an aircraft. Dual controls allow the aircraft to be flown from either

must be equipped with fully functioning dual controls.
dual flight. Flight time that is received and logged as training time. Dual flight
time must be endorsed by a certified flight instructor.
dual ignition. An ignition system of an aircraft reciprocating engine that has two
of every critical unit, including two spark plugs in each cylinder. Dual ignition
provides safety in the event of one system malfunctioning, but more important,
igniting the fuel-air mixture inside the cylinder at two locations provides more
efficient expansion of the air in the cylinder.
dual indicator (aircraft instrument). An aircraft instrument in which two
instrument mechanisms move pointers across a single dial. Many engine
instruments installed in multiengine aircraft are dual indicators. For example, the
oil pressure for both engines may be indicated on a single instrument. There are
two separate indicator mechanisms and two pointers, but only one instrument
case and one dial.
dual magneto. A magneto having a single rotating magnet and cam, but two sets
of breaker points, two coils, two condensers, and two distributors. A dual
magneto is considered to be the equivalent of two separate ignition systems for
an aircraft engine.

which there are two main rotors driven by coaxial drive shafts. The rotors turn in
opposite directions so their torques counteract each other.
dual-spool gas-turbine engine. An axial-flow turbine engine that has two
independent compressors, each driven by its own stage or stages of turbines. The
high-pressure, or N2, compressor is speed governed by the fuel control, but the
low-pressure, or N1, compressor is not governed but seeks its own best speed as
the ambient air density changes.
DUATS. See direct user access terminal system.
duckbill pliers (mechanic’s hand tools). A special type of pliers used to twist
safety wire. Duckbill pliers have long handles and wide, flat jaws with serrations

drawn into a thin section without breaking. Because copper has a great deal of
ductility, it is possible to draw it into very fine wires.
duct losses (gas turbine engine losses). A decrease in pressure of the air flowing
into a gas turbine engine caused by friction.
due regard (air traffic control). A phase of flight in which an aircraft commander
of a state-operated aircraft assumes responsibility to separate his/her aircraft
from all other aircraft, and assures that an appropriate monitoring agency
assumes responsibility for search and rescue actions. Commanders operating
under “due regard” must do so under at least one of the following conditions: (a)
in visual meteorological conditions (VMC); (b) within radar surveillance and
radio communications of a surface radar facility; (c) be equipped with airborne
radar that is sufficient to provide separation between his/her aircraft (and any
other aircraft he/she may be controlling), and other aircraft; or (d) operate within
Class G airspace. The pilot and controller should concur regarding the intent of
the pilot and the status of the flight before the aircraft leaves the ATC frequency.
dummy load. A noninductive, high-power resistor that can be connected to a
transmission line in place of the antenna. The transmitter can be operated into
the dummy load without transmitting any signal.
dump chute (aircraft fuel system component). A specially shaped duct, or tube,
used to carry fuel away from the aircraft when it is dumped from the fuel tanks.
Some large aircraft are permitted to take off with a greater weight than they are
allowed to have when they land. However, if such an aircraft must make an
emergency landing before it has burned off enough fuel to reduce its weight to
its legal landing weight, it must dump enough fuel to get rid of this excess
weight. The dump chute is designed to carry the fuel away from the aircraft so it
will not be ignited by the engine exhaust or by static electricity.

duo-servo brakes (type of aircraft shoe brakes). A form of shoe brake that uses
the weight of the aircraft to wedge the shoes tightly against the drum when the
aircraft is rolling either forward or backward.
duplexer (radio communication device). A device that isolates the receiver from
the transmitter while permitting them to share a common antenna.
duplex fuel nozzle (gas turbine engine component). A type of fuel nozzle that
discharges its fuel into the combustor, or burner, at two different rates and flow
patterns; one for low airflow and the other for high airflow. These flow patterns
determine the shape of the flame inside the burner and both flow patterns keep
the flame centered in the burner so it will not touch the thin metal of which the
burner is made.
duplex operation (electronic communications). A method of communications in
which each end can simultaneously transmit and receive. Communication by
telephone is duplex operation. Duplex operation by radiotelephone requires the
use of two frequencies.

time between overhauls, or TBO.
dural (structural material). See duralumin.
duralumin. The trade name for one of the original alloys of aluminum,
magnesium, manganese, and copper. Duralumin, which is the same as modern

rotates between the time the breaker points close and the time they open. This
determines the amount of time current flows in the primary winding of the
ignition coil.

turbine engine oil tank into which the scavenged oil is returned. Entrapped air
can separate from the oil in this chamber before it is picked up by the pressure
pump.
dwell time (penetrant inspection). The length of time a penetrant is allowed to
remain on the surface of a part being inspected. The dwell time is determined by
the temperature of the part and the size of the suspected defect.
dye. A colored substance used to add a more or less permanent color to another
object. Dyes are added to aviation gasoline to give each grade an identifying
color. Dyes are also used to add an attractive color to the oxide film that forms
when aluminum alloys are anodized.

dye penetrant inspection. A method of nondestructive inspection used to detect
surface defects in metal or plastic parts. The part to be inspected is soaked in a
penetrating liquid for a specified period of time, and then all the penetrant is
washed from its surface. The surface is then covered with a developing powder
that pulls the penetrant from any defects that extend to the surface of the part.
The penetrant plainly shows up on the powder-covered surface, outlining the
defect.
dynafocal engine mount (reciprocating engine mount). A special type of mount
for an aircraft engine in which straight lines that pass through the engine mount
bolts intersect at the center of gravity of the engine and propeller assembly.
Dynafocal engine mounts absorb much of the torsional vibration caused by the
engine.
dynamic (air traffic control). Continuous review, evaluation, and change to meet
demands.
dynamic balance. The balance of a rotating object, such as a wheel or propeller
spinner. The condition of dynamic balance is checked with the object rotating. If
an unbalanced condition causes vibration, the balancing equipment shows the
amount of weight and the location of the weight needed to stop the vibration.
Wheels and tires, as well as propellers, are dynamically balanced.
dynamic braking (electrical braking). Braking of an electric motor done by
switching the power leads of the motor from the source of power to an electrical
load. The electrical load consumes power which is changed to a mechanical
force that opposes the rotation of the motor armature.
dynamic damper (reciprocating engine component). Heavy weights mounted on
some of the cheeks of a reciprocating engine crankshaft to absorb torsional
vibrations. The weights are attached to the cheek by small pins that ride in larger
holes in the weights. This arrangement allows the weights to rock back and forth
as the crankshaft rotates. It is this rocking motion that absorbs the torsional
vibrations of the engine.

dynamic hydroplaning (braking condition). A condition that exists when landing
on a runway surface with standing water deeper than the tread depth of the tires.
When the brakes are applied, there is a possibility that the wheel will lock up and
the tire will ride on the surface of the water, much like a water ski. When the
tires are hydroplaning, directional control and braking action are virtually
impossible. An effective anti-skid system can minimize the effects of
hydroplaning.
dynamic load (aircraft structural load). The apparent weight of an entire loaded
aircraft. The apparent weight is the actual weight of the aircraft multiplied by the
load factor, which is the increase in weight caused by acceleration.
For example, an aircraft in a properly coordinated 60° banked turn has a load
factor of two. This means that if the loaded aircraft weighs 3,000 pounds, its
dynamic load in a coordinated 60° banked turn is two times 3,000 pounds, or
6,000 pounds.
dynamic magnetic variation (navigation database fix error). A field in a “fix
record” that contains only a computer model-calculated value instead of a
measured value in the record for a waypoint. See also fix record.
dynamic microphone. A type of microphone in which sound pressure vibrates a
cone on which is mounted a coil of wire. The coil vibrates in a magnetic field,
and a voltage is produced in the coil. The frequency and waveform of the
voltage is similar to that of the sound waves that vibrated the cone.
dynamic pressure, q (aerodynamic parameter). The pressure a moving fluid
would have if it were stopped. Dynamic pressure is measured in pounds per
square foot.
dynamic restrictions (air traffic control). Those restrictions imposed by the local
facility on an “as needed” basis to manage unpredictable fluctuations in traffic

demands.
dynamic rollover (helicopter operation). The tendency of a helicopter to roll over
on landing. If one gear is on the ground and the helicopter pivots around that
point, it will continue to roll when a critical angle is exceeded.
dynamic stability (aerodynamics). The stability that causes an aircraft to return
to a condition of straight and level flight after it has been disturbed from this
condition. When an aircraft is disturbed from straight and level flight, its static
stability starts it back in the correct direction; but it overshoots, and the
corrective forces are applied in the opposite direction. The aircraft oscillates
back and forth on both sides of the correct condition, with each oscillation
smaller than the one before it. Dynamic stability is the decreasing of these
restorative oscillations.
dynamite. An explosive made by mixing nitroglycerine with a material such as
sawdust, flour, or starch, and some type of oxygen-supplying salt.
dynamometer (electrical measuring instrument). An electrical measuring
instrument that measures current and voltage at the same time and displays the
results as electrical power. The instrument pointer moves over the dial an
amount proportional to the product of the current and the voltage.
The current being measured flows through two series current coils and
produces a fixed electromagnetic field whose strength is proportional to the
amount of current. The voltage being measured forces current to flow through a
movable voltage coil and produces a magnetic field proportional to the amount
of voltage.
The pointer, mounted on the movable coil, is restrained by two calibrated
hairsprings. The amount of its rotation is proportional to the strength of the two
magnetic fields, and this makes the movement of the pointer proportional to the
amount of power being measured.
dynamometer (mechanical measuring instrument). A device used to measure the
amount of torque being produced by a rotating machine. The rotating machine is
loaded with either an electric generator or a fluid pump whose output is
measured and converted into units of mechanical power. A dynamometer
measures the torque the machine produces at a specific RPM, and this data is
converted into brake horsepower.

dynamotor (electrical machine). An electrical machine that converts low-voltage
DC into high-voltage DC. The dynamotor has two armatures on its single
rotating shaft, and these armatures turn inside of two sets of field coils. One set
of field coils and one armature is for a low-voltage DC motor, and the other set
of field coils and armature are for a high-voltage DC generator. A dynamotor is
also called a rotary converter.
dyne. A unit of force in the centimeter-gram-second system of units. One dyne is
the amount of force needed to cause a mass of one gram to accelerate one
centimeter per second, each second it is acted on. One dyne is equal to 2.248 ·
10−6 pounds.

early enough to allow fighters to intercept and destroy the threat before it
reaches its target.
earplug (hearing protector). A device made of rubber or some type of soft plastic
worn in the ear canal to prevent loud noises damaging the delicate mechanism in
the ear. Earplugs or other types of hearing protectors must be worn when
working on most jet aircraft flight lines to prevent hearing loss.

radar beacon tracking system. It functions much the same as terminal ARTS
IIIA, except that it is capable of employing both short-range and long-range
radars, it uses full digital radar displays, and has a fail-safe design.
Easy-Out (hand tool). The registered trade name for a type of screw extractor (a
tool used to remove broken screws or studs from their holes). An Easy-Out is
made of hardened steel and has a tapered, left-hand spiral. A hole is drilled in the
broken shank of the screw, and the Easy-Out is screwed into it by turning it to
the left. The spiral wedges tightly into the broken screw and allows the Easy-Out
to unscrew it from its hole.
ECAM (electronic centralized aircraft monitor). An electronic instrument system
that monitors the functions of the entire aircraft and displays the information on
two color multifunction displays in the aircraft cockpit. The left-hand display
shows the status of the systems, and the right-hand display shows diagrams and
additional information about the system shown on the left-hand display.
eccentric. Two or more circular objects turning in the same plane, but having
different centers.
eccentric bushing (airplane rigging component). A special bushing used between
the rear spar of certain cantilever airplane wings and the wing attachment fitting
on the fuselage. The portion of the bushing that fits through the hole in the spar
is slightly offset from that which passes through the holes in the fitting. By
rotating the bushing, the rear spar may be moved up or down to adjust the root
incidence of the wing.
eccentric cam. A circular cam mounted on a shaft, with its center different from
the center of the shaft. As the shaft rotates about its axis, the outside of the
eccentric rises and falls, changing rotary motion into linear motion.

ECCM (electronic counter-countermeasures). Tactics used in military aircraft to
reduce the effectiveness of the countermeasures used by the enemy against
electronic countermeasures.
echo (radar meteorology). An image formed on a radarscope by energy reflected
or scattered from a target.

deceive enemy radar. Chaff, made of strips of metal foil or metalized glass
fibers, is released to form a large radar return to decoy the enemy radar away
from the true target.
Electromagnetic radiation over a wide band of frequencies can prevent the
enemy receiving radio transmissions. This form of ECM is called jamming.
economizer system (fuel metering system). The system in a carburetor or fuel
injection system that meters additional fuel to the engine when the throttle is
wide open. This additional fuel removes some of the heat from the cylinders
when the engine is producing maximum power.
Economizer systems, also called power-enrichment systems, allow the engine
to operate with an economical fuel-air mixture for all conditions except full
power.
E-core (electric transformer core). The core of a transformer on which the
windings, or coils, are mounted. The core is made of thin sheets (laminations) of

the legs of the core, and the opening is closed with strips of the same material
cut in the shape of the letter I.
eddy (meteorology). A local irregularity of wind in a larger scale wind flow.
Small-scale eddies produce turbulent conditions.

eddy current (induced electrical current). Current induced in the core of a
transformer or the armature core of a motor or generator by current flowing in
the winding. Eddy currents cause a power loss and are minimized by making the
core of thin soft-iron laminations insulated from each other by a thin coat of
varnish. Eddy currents can also be induced in a conductor by a moving or
nonuniform magnetic field.
eddy current damping. Decreasing the amplitude of oscillations by the
interaction of magnetic fields. In the case of a vertical-card magnetic compass,
flux from the oscillating permanent magnet produces eddy currents in a damping
disk or cup. The magnetic flux produced by the eddy currents opposes the flux
from the permanent magnet and decreases the oscillations.
eddy current inspection (nondestructive inspection method). A form of
nondestructive inspection used to locate faults in a metal part. Eddy currents are
induced into the part being inspected and also into a similar part known to be
sound. The presence of a defect is indicated by a difference in the amount of
current needed to induce the eddy current in the two parts.
eddy current losses (electrical machinery). The loss of electrical power caused
by eddy currents induced into the cores of transformers and the armatures of
generators and motors. This lost power produces heat.

certain types of plastic molding.
eductor. A form of jet pump used to pick up one liquid and mix it with another.
Eductors are used in some aircraft fuel systems to remove fuel from a vent-drain
tank and return it to the main tank. Fuel from the boost pump flowing through
the eductor produces a low pressure that pulls fuel from the vent-drain tank and
carries it back into the main tank.
EEC (electronic engine control). An electronic fuel control for a gas turbine
engine. The EEC senses the power-lever angle (PLA), engine RPM, bleed valve,
and variable stator vane position, and the various engine pressures and
temperatures. It meters the correct amount of fuel to the nozzles for all flight
conditions to prevent turbine overspeed and overtemperature.

effect, law of (in learning process). Thorndike’s principle of learning that says
the learning effect is strengthened when accompanied by a pleasant or satisfying
feeling, and that learning is weakened when associated with an unpleasant
feeling.
effective value (AC electricity). The value of sine wave alternating current
needed to produce the same amount of heat as this value of direct current. The
effective value of sine wave AC is 0.707 time its peak value. This means that
AC having a peak value of one amp will produce as much heat as
, or 0.707
amp of direct current.
Effective value, also called root mean square, or rms, value of alternating
current is found by: (1) squaring all the instantaneous values of the current or
voltage in one alternation; then (2) averaging these values; and then (3) finding

the square root of this average. Most AC voltmeters are calibrated to show the
effective value of the voltage they measure.
effective voltage. A measure of AC voltage that is 0.707 times the maximum
instantaneous voltage. It is also called rms (root mean square) voltage.
efficiency. A measure of the effectiveness of a system or device. Efficiency is
found by dividing the output of the device by its input, and it is usually
expressed as a percentage. If the output of a device is exactly the same as its
input, the device has an efficiency of 100%. If its output is only one half of its
input, its efficiency is 50%.
effort arm. The distance on a lever between the fulcrum and the point of
application of the force or weight.
EFIS (electronic flight instrument system). A complete electronic flight
instrumentation system that includes the EICAS (engine indicating and crew
alerting system) and the ECAM (electronic centralized monitoring) system. See
EICAS and ECAM.
E-gap angle (magneto measurement). The position of the rotating magnet in a
magneto when the breaker points are timed to open. The E-gap (efficiency gap)
angle is several degrees of magnet rotation beyond the magnet’s neutral position.
At this point the magnetic field stress is the greatest, and the change in flux is the
greatest, inducing the maximum voltage in the secondary winding.
E-glass (composites). Electrical glass; the borosilicate glass most often used for
the glass fibers in conventional reinforced plastics.
egocentric (electronic display). Used to define the view of a display image that
correlates to inside the aircraft; for example, what the flight crew would see out
the window from a forward-facing perspective. See exocentric.
EGT (exhaust gas temperature). The temperature of the gases as they leave the
cylinder of a reciprocating engine or the turbine of a gas turbine engine.
EGT indicating system (gas turbine engine). An indicating system used with a
gas turbine engine to measure the temperature of the exhaust gases as they enter
the tail pipe, after passing through the turbine. The turbine inlet, a point just
before the exhaust gases enter the turbine, is the most critical location inside a
gas turbine engine with regard to temperature. But it is very difficult to measure
the temperature at this location.

The temperature of the gases after they have passed through the turbine is easy
to measure, and this temperature relates to that of the gases at the turbine inlet.
The EGT system consists of a number of thermocouples connected in parallel
and arranged around the tail pipe so they measure the average temperature of the
exhaust gases.
EGT indicating system (reciprocating engine). A system for measuring the
exhaust gas temperature (EGT) of a reciprocating engine to give the pilot an
indication of the efficiency with which the fuel-air mixture inside the cylinders is
burning. A thermocouple mounted in the exhaust stack just a few inches from
the cylinder measures the temperature of the exhaust gases as they leave the
cylinder.
The fuel-air mixture that produces the highest EGT contains 15 parts of air to
one part of fuel, by weight. The pilot can lean the fuel-air mixture while
watching the EGT indicator until the EGT peaks (reaches its highest point and
then starts back down). When the temperature peaks, the engine is burning a
fuel-air mixture of 0.067 (an air-fuel ratio of 15:1). By enriching the mixture
(adding more fuel) until the temperature drops a specified amount, the pilot
knows the fuel-air mixture is correct to develop the most efficient operation
without danger of detonation.
EGT indicator. A thermocouple-type instrument that shows the temperature of
the gas leaving the exhaust valve of a reciprocating engine or in the tail cone of a
turbine engine. EGT of a reciprocating engine is measured by a chromel-alumel
thermocouple probe inserted into one or more exhaust pipes near the cylinder.
EGT of a turbine engine is measured by averaging the output of a series of
chromel-alumel thermocouples connected in parallel and arranged around the
tail cone just aft of the last stage of turbine.

EHSI (electronic horizontal situation indicator). An electronic flight instrument
that displays navigation information on a multicolor display. An EHSI is used in
conjunction with an EADI.
The information displayed on an EHSI include: magnetic track, aircraft
heading, ground speed, distance to go, VOR course, wind speed and direction,
ILS display, and a visual display of the flight plan. See EADI.
EICAS (engine indication and crew alerting system). An electronic instrument
system for modern turbine-powered aircraft that senses engine parameters and
displays them on one of two multicolor display units on the instrument panel.
The EICAS evaluates changes in any of the parameters and, based on
programmed limits, warns the flight crew of any changes that could signal an
impending problem. Only vital information is shown at all times, but any of the
sensed parameters are automatically displayed when they fall outside of their
allowable range of operation.
eight-harness satin (composites). A weave for composite fabric that is to be
draped over complex shapes with a high degree of smoothness. Each warp
thread passes over one fill thread and under seven. See satin-weave fabric.
eights around pylons (flight training maneuver). A ground-track maneuver in
which the airplane flies a figure-eight pattern, maintaining a constant radius
around two points, or pylons. The objective is to learn to correct for wind drift.
einsteinium. A synthetic, radioactive chemical element produced by neutron
bombardment of uranium in cyclotrons. Einsteinium whose symbol is Es, and its

atomic number is 99 was first discovered in the debris of a nuclear explosion.
ejection seat (military aircraft component). A type of seat installed in a military
aircraft that may be shot out of the aircraft with a powder charge in the event of
an inflight emergency.
ejector (jet pump). A form of jet pump used to pick up a liquid and move it to
another location. Ejectors are used in an aircraft fuel system to assure that the
compartment in which the boost pumps are mounted is kept full of fuel. Part of
the fuel from the boost pump flowing through the ejector produces a low
pressure that pulls fuel from the main tank and forces it into the boost-pump
sump area.
elasticity. The ability of a material to be elongated, or stretched, by pulling on it,
and to return to its original size and configuration after the force causing the
elongation is removed.
elastic limit (material strength). The maximum amount of tensile load, in pounds
per square inch, a material is able to withstand without being permanently
deformed. Any time a material is loaded to less than its elastic limit and the load
is released, the material will return to its original size and configuration. When
loaded beyond its elastic limit, it will deform and not return to its original
condition.
Elastic Stop Nut. The registered trade name of a special type of self-locking nut.
A collar of fiber whose inside diameter is slightly smaller than the diameter of
the threads on which the nut is screwed is swaged into a recess in the end of the
nut. Forcing the threads into the fiber prevents vibration loosening the nut.
elastomer. A material, such as synthetic rubber, that can be stretched at room
temperature to at least twice its original length. When it is released, it will return
to its original size and shape.
elastomeric bearing. A type of bearing used for oscillating loads where complete
rotation is not needed. An elastomeric bearing is made of alternate layers of an
elastomer, a rubber-like material, and metal, bonded together. Elastomeric
bearings can be designed to take radial loads, axial loads, or torsional loads.
E-layer (atmosphere). An ionized layer of the atmosphere existing at an altitude
of between 60 and 75 miles (100 to 120 kilometers) above the earth. Radio

waves bounce off the E-layer. The effect of the E-layer is most noticeable in the
daytime, and to a lesser degree at night.
elbow (fluid line fitting). A type of fitting used to join two pieces of tubing at an
angle of 90°.
Elcon connector (battery connector). The registered trade name for a special type
of connector used to connect a high-output battery to an aircraft electrical
system. The connector is held tightly to the two battery terminals by pressure
exerted by a hand screw.
electret. A dielectric (insulating) material that is permanently polarized. Electret
is made by heating a material such as barium titanate ceramic or carnauba wax
and holding it in a strong electric field as it cools. The electric field surrounding
electret is much like the magnetic field surrounding a piece of magnetized steel.
electret microphone. An acoustic transducer, a device that changes sound
pressure into an electrical signal. A diaphragm made of a thin foil of electret is
placed next to a metal-coated backplate. Sound pressure picked up by the
microphone vibrates the diaphragm and, as the electric field cuts across the
metal plate, it generates a voltage. The waveform of this voltage is a copy of the
waveform of the sound that vibrated the diaphragm to produce it.
electrical bonding. The process of connecting the structural parts of an aircraft
together with conductors to keep them all at the same electrical potential.
Bonding prevents sparks caused by static electricity from jumping between the
parts and causing radio interference.
electrical bus (electrical system component). A distribution point in an electrical
system to which the battery and generator are connected, and from which the
electrical loads receive their power.
electrical charge. Electrical energy stored on the surface of an object. This
charge is produced by the accumulation of electrons in one area and a shortage,
or deficiency, of electrons in another area.
electrical diagram. A line drawing using schematic symbols to show the
relationship of all the components in an electrical system.

electrical energy. Energy possessed by a material or device because of an
unequal distribution of electrons. Chemical energy, mechanical energy, heat
energy, and light energy can all be converted into electrical energy.
electrical generator. A machine that converts mechanical energy into electrical
energy. Mechanical energy is used to move conductors through a magnetic field,
and voltage is induced into them as they cut across the lines of magnetic flux.
electrical insulator. A material that offers a large amount of opposition to the
flow of electrons. Glass, most types of plastic, ceramics, and a vacuum are
examples of electrical insulators.
electrically suspended gyroscope. A gyroscope whose rotor is supported in either
an electrostatic or electromagnetic field, rather than in conventional bearings.
The gyroscope spins with an absolute minimum of friction while it is supported
in either of these fields.
electrical potential. The electrical force caused by a deficiency of electrons in
one location and an excess of electrons in another. Electrical potential is
measured in volts.
electrical resistance welding. A method of welding thin sheets of metal by
clamping them tightly together and passing electric current through them. The
heat produced by the current melts the metal, and the pressure forces the molten
metal from the two sheets together. Spot welding and seam welding are both
types of electrical resistance welding.

electrical shield. A housing made of a conductive material such as copper or
aluminum that encloses an electrical circuit. The shield picks up stray electrical
energy radiated from the circuit and carries it to ground so it cannot interfere
with any other electrical or electronic equipment.
The ignition systems used on almost all aircraft reciprocating engines are
electrically shielded by enclosing the entire system in a conductive covering that
is electrically grounded to the engine.
electrical short (electrical system fault). An unwanted connection that provides a
low-resistance path across an electrical circuit. Electrons flow through the short
to ground without passing through the load.
electrical steel. An alloy of low-carbon steel that contains up to about 5%
silicon. Electrical steel in the form of thin laminations is used for the cores of
transformers and armatures of electrical motors and generators.
electrical strain gage. A device used to measure the amount of physical strain
(deformation caused by a stress) in a piece of material. A strain gage is made of
very fine wire mounted between two pieces of tissue paper, about the size of a
postage stamp. The strain gage is bonded (glued) to the material in which the
strain is to be measured, and the two ends of the wire are connected into a
sensitive resistance-measuring bridge circuit.
When the material on which the strain gage is mounted is under a tensile stress,
the wire in the strain gage stretches—it becomes longer and thinner, and its
resistance increases. When the material is under a compressive stress, the wire
becomes shorter and larger in diameter, and its resistance decreases. The change
in resistance is proportional to the amount of strain in the material, and the
amount of strain is proportional to the amount of stress causing it.

electrical strength. The maximum amount of electrical pressure (voltage) that
can be placed across an insulator before it breaks down and allows electrons to
flow through it.
electrical symbols. Standardized graphic symbols that have been agreed upon as
representing various components in electrical schematic diagrams.
electrical zero (synchro system). A specific position of the rotor inside the stator
of a synchro (a remotely controlled position indicating system). Electrical zero is
used as a reference position for meshing gears and installing indicator pointers.
electric drill motor. A series-wound, alternating-current motor used to drive a
chuck which holds a twist drill. The motor is geared down so that it furnishes a
high torque to the chuck.
electric inertia starter (reciprocating engine starter). A type of starter for large
aircraft reciprocating engines. A series-wound electric motor spins a heavy
flywheel to store energy. When the flywheel is spinning at a high speed, the
motor is disconnected, and the flywheel is connected to the engine crankshaft
through a series of reduction gears and a slip clutch.
electricity. A force caused by electrons moving from one atom to another. A
deficiency of electrons is called a positive charge, and an excess of electrons is
called a negative charge. The difference in electrical charges causes electrical
pressure. When electrical pressure forces electrons to move in a conductor, heat
is produced, and a magnetic field surrounds the conductor.
electroacoustic transducer. A device that changes either variations in sound
pressure into variations of electrical pressure (voltage), or variations in voltage
into variations of sound pressure. Microphones and speakers are both examples
of electroacoustic transducers.
electrochemical series. A list of metals arranged according to their electrode
potential. Metals highest in the list give up electrons to all metals below them.
When corrosion occurs, the metal highest in the series will be the one that is
corroded, or eaten away.
The electrochemical series is also known as the electromotive series.

electrochemistry. The aspects of chemistry that deal with electron potentials
within the different chemical elements.
electrode. A conductor, or part of an electrical component through which
electrons flow to or from an external circuit. The carbon rod and zinc can are
electrodes in a carbon-zinc battery. The emitter, base, and collector are the
electrodes in a bipolar transistor.
electrode potential. A voltage existing within an alloy of metals or in any type of
electrochemical cell. The electrode potential is caused by chemical differences of
the materials involved, and it causes electrons to flow within the material any
time there is a conductive path between the different materials.
electrodynamic damping (electrical meter damping). The decreasing amplitude
of pointer oscillation of an electrical meter, caused by the generation of a voltage
in the moving coil as it oscillates back and forth in the field of a permanent
magnet. Energy used to produce current in the moving coil decreases the energy
causing the oscillations.
electrodynamics. The aspect of electricity that deals with electrons in motion.
This includes the effects of magnetism and induction. The other aspect of
electricity is electrostatics, which deals with electrical charges caused by
electrons that are stationary.
electrogalvanizing. The process of electrolytically depositing a layer of zinc on
sheets of steel.
electrohydraulic. Hydraulic control which is electrically actuated.

electroluminescence. The emission of light caused by the application of a strong
electrical field to certain materials. It is not caused by the heating effect of the
electricity.
electrolysis. The process in which the chemical composition of a material is
changed by passing electrical current through it. When DC electricity passes
through water, the water breaks down into its two chemical constituents,
hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen bubbles form on the negative electrode, and
oxygen bubbles form on the positive electrode.
electrolyte. A chemical solution, either a liquid or a gas, that conducts electrical
current by releasing ions (unbalanced atoms) that unite with oppositely charged
ions on the electrodes. Negative ions, atoms having an excess of electrons, move
through the electrolyte to the positive electrode. Positive ions, atoms having a
deficiency of electrons, move to the negative electrode.
A lead-acid battery uses an electrolyte of sulfuric acid and water. When the
battery is being charged, negative sulfate ions from the plates join positive
hydrogen ions in the water and form sulfuric acid. When the battery discharges,
negative sulfate ions leave the electrolyte and go to both plates. Positive
hydrogen ions left from the sulfuric acid join negative oxygen ions from the
positive plate and form water.
The condition of charge of a lead-acid battery can be determined by measuring
the specific gravity of the electrolyte with a hydrometer. The specific gravity
shows the amount of acid in the electrolyte.
electrolytic capacitor. A capacitor that uses metal foil for the electrodes and an
extremely thin film of metallic oxide, a nonconductor, as the dielectric. Two
sheets of metal foil separated by a piece of porous paper impregnated with an
electrolyte are the plates. The dielectric is an oxide film formed on the surface of
one of the plates.
The capacity of a capacitor is inversely proportional to the thickness of the
dielectric—the thinner the dielectric, the greater the capacity. And, since the
oxide film is extremely thin, an electrolytic capacitor has a large capacity for its
physical size.
One major disadvantage of an electrolytic capacitor is its low DC working
voltage compared with that of other types of capacitors. The thin oxide film can
be easily punctured by a high voltage. An oxide film on a piece of metal acts as a
rectifier. Electrons can pass from the metal through the film into the electrolyte.
But they cannot pass from the electrolyte through the film to the metal.

Because of this rectifying action, electrolytic capacitors must never be used in
AC circuits, and they must be installed in a DC circuit with their anode, the
terminal marked with a plus sign, connected to the positive voltage.

electrolytic dissociation. The reduction of certain chemical compounds into their
composite elements by passing electricity through them. When electrical current
passes through water, it dissociates into hydrogen and oxygen.
electromagnet. A magnet produced by electrical current flowing through a coil
of wire. The coil of an electromagnet is normally wound around a core of soft
iron. This soft iron has an extremely low retentivity so it releases the material
being picked up as soon as current stops flowing through the coil.
electromagnetic emission (electronic communications). The radiation of
electromagnetic energy for communications. There are six types of amplitudemodulated emission classified by international agreement. These are:
A0. Unmodulated continuous-wave
A1. Telegraphy, or pure continuous wave
A2. Modulated telegraphy
A3. Telephony
A4. Facsimile
A5. Television
electromagnetic induction. The transfer of electrical energy from one conductor
to another that is not electrically connected. This transfer is done by a changing
magnetic field produced by current flowing in one conductor cutting across the

other conductor. As the lines of flux expand and collapse across the conductor, a
voltage is induced in it.
electromagnetic interference. See EMI.
electromagnetic radiation. One method by which energy is transmitted from one
location to another. Radio and television signals, for example, reach us by
electromagnetic radiation. When electric and magnetic fields oscillate back and
forth at a high enough frequency, they extend out into space in the form of
waves. These waves may be absorbed (received) at some distant point. Very
little energy transmitted by electromagnetic radiation is lost, or used up, by the
space between the point from which it is sent and the point at which it is
received. Energy from the sun reaches the earth by electromagnetic radiation,
and only a very small amount of this energy is lost in the empty space between
the sun and the earth.
electromagnetic vibrator. A device that interrupts a flow of direct current and
changes it into pulsating DC. An electromagnetic vibrator consists of an
electrical relay whose contacts are held closed by a spring and opened by the
pull of the electromagnetic coil. The contacts and coil are connected in series
across a source of direct current.
When current flows through the coil, the magnetic field pulls the contacts open
and stops the current. When the current stops flowing, the spring closes the
contacts and current begins to flow again. The contacts vibrate between open
and closed as long as the vibrator is connected to a source of direct current.
electromagnetic waves. Vibrations of electric and magnetic fields that move at
the speed of light. Electromagnetic waves radiate out at right angles to the
direction of their wave motion.
electromagnetism. The magnetic field surrounding a current-carrying conductor.
The strength of the field is determined by the amount of current flowing in the
conductor.
electromechanical frequency meter. A type of instrument that uses the resonant
frequency of a vibrating metal reed to measure the frequency of alternating
current.
Metal reeds having different lengths are vibrated by electromagnetism
produced by the alternating current. The reed whose resonant frequency is the
same as that of the AC will vibrate with the greatest amplitude, and the resonant

frequency of this reed is shown on a calibrated scale on the face of the
instrument. An electromechanical frequency meter is also called a vibrating-reed
frequency meter.
electromotive force. See EMF.
electron. The negatively charged part of an atom of which all matter is made.
Electrons circle around the nucleus of an atom in orbits, or shells, and electrons
of certain atoms can be forced out of their outer shell and caused to move from
one atom to another to produce a flow called electron current.
electron beam. A thin stream of electrons all moving in the same direction under
the influence of electrical or magnetic fields. Electron beams may be focused
and directed by these fields. When an electron beam strikes certain phosphors,
electroluminescence is produced and the phosphor glows. This is the way the
image is formed on a television screen and on the face of a cathode-ray tube.
electron-beam welding. A method of welding metal by the heat produced when a
high-speed stream of electrons strikes the metal. Electron-beam welding is used
in applications in which the heat must be concentrated at the point the weld is
being made.
electron current. The movement of electrons through a circuit from the negative
terminal of the power source to its positive terminal.
Electron current moves in the direction opposite the direction of the
arrowheads in the symbol for a semiconductor diode. These symbols are drawn
to follow conventional current, an imaginary flow considered to be from positive
to negative. Electron current is the actual movement of electrons.

electron drift. The relatively slow movement of individual electrons through a
conductor. Electron drift is not the same as electron flow, or electron current.
electron gun. An electron-emitting cathode in a cathode-ray tube. Grids
associated with the cathode accelerate, control, and focus the beam of electrons
to form a spot of the desired size on the face of the tube.
electronic. Relating to the application of the flow of free electrons through
semiconductor devices and across a vacuum.
electronic emission. The discharge of electrons from a material. Electrons are
held tightly in their atoms, but certain kinds of outside energy can cause them to
move from one atom to another. When heat energy causes electrons to leave, the
emission is called thermal emission. When the electrons are moved out of their
atoms by light energy, the emission is called photoemission.
electronic flight bag (EFB). An electronic display system intended primarily for
cockpit or cabin use that can display a variety of aviation data or perform basic
calculations (e.g., performance data, fuel calculations, etc.). Some of these
functions were traditionally accomplished using paper references or were based
on data provided to the flight crew by an airline’s “flight dispatch” function.
electronic flight display (EFD). For the purpose of standardization, any flight
instrument display that uses an LCD or other image-producing system, e.g.,
cathode ray tube (CRT), etc.
electronic flight instruments. Flight instruments that use electronic devices to
prepare and/or present information such as airspeed, attitude, altitude, and
position.
electronic horizontal situation indicator (EHSI). An electronically generated HSI
display, either CRT or LCD type, indicating all standard HSI functions on a
video screen instead of using mechanical components.
electronic leak detector (air conditioning system servicing tool). An electronic
oscillator whose frequency changes if refrigerant gas is picked up in its sensor
tube. The sensor tube is held below a suspected leak, and if any refrigerant is
leaking, the sound produced by the oscillator will change from a low tone to a
high-pitched squeal. Electronic leak detectors can detect a leak as small as a few
parts of refrigerant gas in a million parts of air.
electronic learning (e-learning). Any type of education that involves an

electronic component such as the Internet, a network, a stand-alone computer,
CD/DVDs, video conferencing, websites, or e-mail in its delivery.
electronic oscillator. An electronic circuit that converts DC electricity into AC
electricity.
electronics. The study and use of the movement of free electrons. In electricity,
we normally think of the movement of electrons only through conductors; but in
electronics, we also consider the movement of electrons through materials that
are not always conductors. Electrons can be caused to flow through a vacuum
and through semiconductor materials such as silicon and germanium.
electronic speed controller (ESC). An electronic circuit used to convert the direct
current (DC) provided by the flight battery into the alternating current (AC)
required to operate brushless motors.
electronic voltmeter. A special type of electronic instrument used to measure
voltage. Electronic voltmeters use electron tubes or solid-state components, such
as field-effect transistors (FET), to amplify the voltage being measured before it
is read by the indicating instrument. An electronic voltmeter has a much higher
input impedance than a nonelectronic meter, and it can measure AC voltages
having a wider range of frequencies.
electron volt (eV). The unit of energy that is acquired by an electron when it
passes through a potential difference of one volt in a vacuum. One electron volt
is equal to approximately 1.602 · 10−19 volt.
electron-pair bond. Bonding of the atoms within a crystal by the sharing of
valence electrons.
electron spin. The rotation of an electron about its own axis. Electron spin is not
the same as the rotation of an electron about the nucleus of its atom.
electron transit time. The length of time required for an electron to travel
between two points in an electronic device. While this time appears to be
extremely short, it is an important factor in designing high-speed electronic
computers.
electron tube. The correct term for an electronic component which normally goes
by the name of vacuum tube or valve. An electron tube is a form of electron
control valve. Electron tubes have a heated cathode that emits electrons and an
anode, or plate, connected to a high positive voltage that attracts the electrons.

The flow of electrons between the cathode and the anode is controlled by the
voltage on one or one more grids placed between the cathode and anode. The
cathode and its heater, the grids, and the anode, are all housed inside a glass or
metal envelope from which all the oxygen has been removed. The envelope may
be left with a vacuum, or it may be filled with an inert gas.
electroplating. A method of coating one kind of metal with another. Cadmium is
often plated on steel to make it corrosion resistant, and chromium can be plated
on steel to make it hard and wear resistant. The steel is connected to the negative
terminal of a direct current power supply, the cadmium or chromium is
connected to the positive terminal, and both metals are immersed in an
electrolyte.
Ionized atoms of cadmium or chromium in the electrolyte are deposited on the
steel, and these atoms are replaced from the cadmium or chromium electrode.
electropolishing. The production of a smooth finish on a piece of metal by
submerging it in a suitable electrolyte and making it the anode in an electrolytic
process. The surface roughness is electrolytically removed.
electrostatic charge. An electrical charge that can exist on the plates of a
capacitor or on an insulated object. A negative electrostatic charge is caused by
an accumulation of electrons, and a positive charge is caused by a lack of
electrons.
electrostatic deflection. A method of controlling the position of a beam of
electrons on the face of a cathode-ray tube. The beam of electrons that forms the
trace on a cathode-ray tube may be deflected to the correct position on the screen
by electrostatic charges on plates placed above and below the beam, and on each
side of the beam.
If, for example, the top plate is given a positive charge, and the bottom plate a
negative charge, the electrons in the beam (all electrons are negative) will deflect
away from the lower plate toward the upper plate. The beam will deflect upward.
electrostatic energy. Energy stored by an electric stress in the dielectric of a
capacitor when two opposing electrical charges act across the dielectric. When a
battery is connected across the two plates of a capacitor, electrons are pulled
from one plate and forced into the other. When all the electrons that can be
moved by the battery have been moved, the capacitor is charged and no more
current flows. The battery can be disconnected, but electron pressure still

remains between the plates. This voltage across the dielectric (the voltage on the
plates) is caused by electrostatic energy.
electrostatic field. The space between two bodies that have opposite electrical
charges. Lines of electrostatic force are considered to leave the negatively
charged body and enter the body having the positive charge. The strength of the
electrostatic field is determined by the number of electrons that make up the
charge, and by the square of the distance separating the bodies.
electrostatics. The aspect of electricity that deals with electrical charges caused
by electrons that are stationary, or not moving. Electrodynamics is the aspect of
electricity that deals with electrons in motion.
element of threat (in learning process). A perception factor describing how a
person is unlikely to easily comprehend an event if feeling threatened since most
of the person’s effort is focused on the threat itself.
elevator (airplane control). The horizontal, movable control surface in the tail
section, or empennage, of an airplane. The elevator is hinged to the trailing edge
of the fixed horizontal stabilizer. Moving the elevator up or down, by fore-andaft movement of the control yoke or stick, changes the aerodynamic force
produced by the horizontal tail surface.
elevator downspring. A spring in the elevator control system that produces a
mechanical force that tries to lower the elevator, and thus the nose of the
airplane. In normal flight this spring force is overcome by the aerodynamic force
from the elevator trim tab. But in slow flight with an aft CG position, the trim
tab loses its effectiveness and the downspring lowers the nose to prevent a stall.
elevator illusion (physiology). The feeling of being in a climb or descent, caused
by the kind of abrupt vertical accelerations that result from up or downdrafts.
elevator trim stall (flight condition). A stall that occurs when full power is
applied to an airplane configured with excessive nose-up trim. Positive control
of the airplane is lost resulting in a stall. This type of stall usually occurs during
a go-around procedure from a normal landing approach or a simulated forced
landing approach, or immediately after takeoff.
elevon (airplane control surface). A combination elevator and aileron. Elevons
are installed on the trailing edge of a delta wing or a flying wing airplane. Fore-

and-aft movement of the control yoke causes the elevons to operate together.
This causes the airplane to rotate about its lateral, or pitch, axis.
Movement of the stick or control wheel to the right or left causes the elevons to
move differentially. The left elevon moves up and the right elevon moves down.
Differential movement of the elevons causes the airplane to rotate about its
longitudinal, or roll, axis.
ellipse. A figure formed when a plane cuts across the axis of a cylinder at an
angle other than a right angle.

ellipsoid of revolution (mathematics). A figure that is generated when an ellipse
is rotated about one of its axes.
ELT (emergency locator transmitter). A small self-contained radio transmitter
carried in an aircraft. If the aircraft crashes, the force of the impact automatically
sets the transmitter into operation, transmitting a series of down-sweeping tones
on the two emergency frequencies of 121.5 and 243.0 megahertz. Searchers who
receive the signal from the ELT are able to locate the wreckage by using radio
direction finding equipment.

The altimeter provides a signal showing the altitude in one-hundred-foot
increments to the radar beacon transponder. The transponder sends this
information in coded form to the ground radar, where it shows up on the radar
screen in numbers beside the radar return from the aircraft.
endothermic action. A chemical action in which heat energy is absorbed.

The portion of a STAR preceding the common route or point, or for a SID the
portion following, that is coded for a specific en route fix, airway or jet route.
entrained air. Air trapped in a liquid, forming an emulsion with it. When
lubricating oil passes through an engine, it picks up large quantities of air, and
this entrained air increases the volume of the oil, making it less effective as a
lubricant.

Entrained air must be removed from the oil by a deaerator system, an air-oil
separator, before it is sent back through the engine.
entrained water. Water held in suspension in the fuel carried in an aircraft fuel
tank. Entrained water does not cause many problems on airplanes powered with
reciprocating engines, but it does cause serious problems with turbine-powered
aircraft. This is because turbine-powered aircraft fly at much higher altitude,
where the air is so cold the entrained water condenses out and freezes on the fuel
filters. This ice shuts off the flow of fuel to the engines. The fuel used in many
turbine-powered aircraft is treated with an anti-icing agent which mixes with and
lowers the freezing point of the water condensed from the fuel in the tanks.

compounds reduce wear and damage to surfaces that are in heavy rubbing
contact. EP lubricants are specially suited for lubricating gear trains.

epicyclic gear train. An arrangement of gears in which one or more gears travel
around the circumference of another. An example of an epicyclic gear train is the
planetary gear arrangement used to reduce the speed of the propeller shaft of a
geared aircraft engine.
One system of planetary gears uses a spur-type sun gear mounted rigidly in the
nose section of the engine, and a ring gear with internal teeth driven by the
crankshaft. The propeller shaft is mounted on a spider having several arms. Each
arm of the spider carries a planetary gear that meshes with and rides between the
sun gear and the ring gear.
As the planetary gears travel around the sun gear, they turn the spider and the
propeller shaft, in the same direction as the crankshaft, but at a slower speed.

provide a good bond for a topcoat system. Epoxy primers are not used in many
of the high-volume production lines because of the time needed for them to cure
properly.

thrust is expressed in terms related to its engine pressure ratio (EPR).

EPS (engineered performance standards) (air traffic control). A mathematically
derived runway capacity standard. EPS’s are calculated for each airport on an
individual basis and reflect that airport’s aircraft mix, operating procedures,
runway layout, and specific weather conditions. EPS’s do not give consideration
to staffing, experience levels, equipment outages, and in-trail restrictions as does
the airport acceptance rate (AAR).
equalization (battery servicing operation). A procedure used with nickelcadmium batteries to bring all the cells to exactly the same state of charge. The
battery is completely discharged and all the cells are shorted and allowed to
stand for several hours with the shorting straps in place. Then the battery is
given a constant-current charge to restore 140% of its ampere-hour capacity.
equalizer circuit (aircraft generator system). A circuit used in a multiengine
generator system that causes the generators to share the electrical load equally. A
low-resistance shunt, called an equalizing resistor, is installed between each
generator and ground so all the current produced by the generator flows through

it. The voltage drop across the equalizing resistors is sensed by the voltage
regulators to control the output of the generators.
When one generator carries more than its share of the load, the voltage drop
across its equalizing resistor is greater than that across the resistors of the other
generators. The voltage regulators sense this difference and decrease the voltage
of the generator carrying the greater part of the load, and in this way force the
other generators to carry their share.
equalizing resistor. A large resistor in the ground circuit of a heavy-duty aircraft
generator through which all of the generator output current flows. The voltage
drop across this resistor is used to produce the current in the paralleling circuit
that forces the generators to share the electrical load equally.

equilibrium. A condition that exists within a body when the sum of the moments
of all of the forces acting on the body is equal to zero. In aerodynamics,
equilibrium is when all opposing forces acting on an aircraft are balanced
(steady, unaccelerated flight conditions).

erosion. The process in which a material is worn away by a scraping or abrading
action.
error chain. A series of mistakes that may lead to an accident or incident. Two
basic principles generally associated with the creation of an error chain are: (1)
one bad decision often leads to another; and (2) as a string of bad decisions
grows, it reduces the number of subsequent alternatives for continued safe flight.
Aeronautical decision making is intended to break the error chain before it
results in an accident or incident.
escape velocity. The speed a flight vehicle must reach in order to escape from
the gravitational field of the earth. The escape velocity on the earth is about
seven miles per second. Because of the smaller gravitational field on Mars, a
vehicle leaving Mars would have an escape velocity of only slightly more than
three miles per second.
ESFC (equivalent specific fuel consumption). A measure of the efficiency of a
turboprop engine. It is the number of pounds of fuel burned per hour to produce
one equivalent shaft horsepower (ESHP) and is found by dividing the fuel flow,
in pounds per hour, by the ESHP.
ESHP (equivalent shaft horsepower). A measure of the power produced by a

turboprop engine. ESHP is the sum of the shaft horsepower delivered to the

from departure point to destination (lift-off to touchdown).
ethanol. Alcohol made from cereal grains such as corn.
ether. A volatile, highly flammable liquid that may be used to prime the
cylinders of an aircraft engine for starting under extremely cold conditions.
ethylene dibromide. A colorless poisonous liquid, BrCH2CH2Br, added to

aviation gasoline to minimize lead fouling of the spark plugs. Tetraethyl lead
improves the antidetonation characteristics of aviation gasoline, but it leaves

before it solidifies and changes it into volatile lead bromides, which pass out
with the exhaust gases.
ethylene glycol. A form of alcohol used as a coolant for liquid-cooled aircraft
engines and as an anti-icing agent. It is also used in automobile engines as a
permanent antifreeze.

ETOPS significant system. An airplane system, including the propulsion system,
that if fails or malfunctions could adversely affect the safety of an ETOPS flight,
or the continued safe flight and landing of an airplane during an ETOPS
diversion. Each ETOPS significant system is either an ETOPS group 1
significant system or an ETOPS group 2 significant system. An ETOPS group 1
significant system: (1) has fail-safe characteristics directly linked to the degree
of redundancy provided by the number of engines on the airplane; (2) is a
system, the failure or malfunction of which could result in an in-flight shutdown,
loss of thrust control, or other power loss; (3) contributes significantly to the
safety of an ETOPS diversion by providing additional redundancy for any
system power source lost as a result of an inoperative engine; and (4) is essential
for prolonged operation of an airplane at engine inoperative altitudes. An
ETOPS group 2 significant system is an ETOPS significant system that is not an
ETOPS group 1 significant system.

melting point. Solder, for example, is an alloy of lead and tin. Lead has a melting
point of 327°C, and tin melts at 232°C. When tin and lead are combined in an
alloy of 63 parts of tin and 37 parts lead, the alloy is eutectic, and it melts at a
temperature of 188°C.
evacuated bellows (pressure instrument reference). A stack of metal bellows
used as a reference for measuring atmospheric pressure. These bellows, made of

circularly corrugated bronze disks, have nearly all the air pumped out of them.
The pressure of the atmosphere compresses the bellows against their inherent

evaporative cooling. See steam cooling.
evaporator (air condition system component). The component in a vapor-cycle
air conditioning system in which the refrigerant absorbs heat from the aircraft

droplets. Warm air from the cabin blows through the fins on the coils, and heat
from this air is absorbed by the refrigerant, changing the droplets of liquid into a
vapor. The heat used to make this change is taken from the air and as a result the
air passing through the evaporator is cooled.

gas turbine engine through which the exhaust gases leave the engine. The area of
the exhaust nozzle is critical, as it affects the back pressure on the turbine, and
this in turn affects the engine RPM, the exhaust gas temperature, and the thrust
the engine produces. Some gas turbine engines use variable-area exhaust
nozzles.
exhaust stacks (reciprocating engine component). Short pipes that carry the
exhaust gases from the cylinder into the surrounding air. Also called exhaust
pipes.

engine cylinder through which exhaust gases leave.

exit guide vanes (gas turbine engine component). Stationary airfoils at the
discharge end of an axial-flow compressor. As the air passes through the

gas which are generated when the constituents of the plastic are mixed.
Expanded plastic is also known as foamed plastic.
expanded-scale meter (electrical meter). A current-measuring analog electrical
indicator whose needle deflection is not uniform over its entire scale. The
amount of deflection for a given input is increased for certain ranges of
indication. Expanded-scale meters are used when small changes in the upper
limit of the value being measured are important.
expanded service volume (air traffic control). When ATC or a procedures
specialist requires the use of a NAVAID beyond the limitations specified for
standard service volume, an ESV may be established. See standard service
volume.
expander-tube brake (aircraft brake). A type of lightweight, nonenergizing,
hydraulically operated aircraft brake. A synthetic rubber tube is installed around
the brake housing mounted on the landing gear axle, and blocks of brake lining
material are held pressed against the expander tube with flat metal springs. The
brake drum, mounted inside the wheel, rotates around the linings.
When the brake pedal is depressed, hydraulic fluid is forced into the tube. The
tube expands and forces the brake blocks against the rotating brake drum. This
force applies enough friction to the drum to slow the rotation of the wheel.

expansion reamer (metal-cutting tool). A precision cutting tool used to smooth
the inside of a drilled hole and enlarge it to an accurately specified dimension.
The diameter of the hole cut by an expansion reamer can be increased a few
thousandths of an inch by adjusting a wedge inside the blades to move them
outward.
expansion turbine (air-cycle air conditioning system component). A small
turbine in an air-cycle cooling system that extracts energy from compressed air
as it drives a compressor. Bleed air containing a large amount of energy is taken
from the turbine-engine compressor. This hot air passes through a primary heat
exchanger where it gives up some of its energy. It is then taken into a
compressor driven by the expansion turbine. Here its pressure and temperature
are both increased. This air then passes through a secondary heat exchanger
where it gives up more of its energy and its temperature is dropped. From here it
flows into the expansion turbine that drives the compressor, using up much of its
remaining energy.
After leaving the turbine, it expands into the air conditioning ducts. Having lost
most of its energy through the heat exchangers and the expansion turbine, the air
is now cold.
expansion wave (high-speed aerodynamics). The change in pressure and velocity
of a supersonic flow of air as it passes over a surface, which drops away from
the flow. As the surface drops away, the air tries to follow it. In changing its
direction, the air speeds up to a higher supersonic velocity, and its static pressure
decreases.
There is no change in the total amount of energy as the air passes through an
expansion wave, and so there is no noise as there is when air passes through a
shock wave.

operate an aircraft that does not have a type certificate or does not conform to its
type certificate and is in a condition for safe operation. This certificate is also
issued to operate a primary category kit-built aircraft assembled without the
supervision or quality control of the production certificate holder. Special
airworthiness certificates in the experimental category may be issued for various
purposes including research and development; showing compliance with

regulations; crew training; exhibition; air racing; market surveys or
demonstrations; and operating amateur-built, kit-built, or light-sport aircraft. An
aircraft with a special airworthiness certificate in the experimental category may
not be used for compensation or hire.
experimental license (aircraft certification). A license issued by the Federal
Aviation Administration that allows an aircraft to be flown for the purpose of
proving its design and construction in order to qualify for a regular license. The
FAA puts certain restrictions on experimental aircraft. These restrictions apply
to the crew allowed to fly in the aircraft and where it can be flown.

certificate under 14 CFR Part 21.
experimental permit. 14 CFR §401.5: “An authorization by the FAA to a person
to launch or reenter a reusable suborbital rocket.”
explode. To make a violent change in the chemical composition of a material.
Usually an explosion is accompanied by a loud noise and the release of light and
heat. When a mixture of gasoline fumes and air in a closed container is ignited, it
explodes. In the explosion, the gasoline and air change into carbon dioxide and
water and produce a loud noise, light, and heat.
exploded-view drawing. A drawing showing all of the parts spread out to show
their relative location in the component.
explosion-proof motor (electric motor). An electric motor totally enclosed in a
housing. Explosive gases cannot get into the housing to explode, and sparks
produced inside the housing cannot ignite gases on the outside.
explosion-proof switch (electrical component). A special electrical switch
enclosed in a housing that prevents the sparks which occur when the contacts
separate from igniting any explosive gases that may be on the outside of the
housing.
explosive atmosphere. Atmosphere (air) which holds explosive vapors or certain
types of powder that can be ignited. Dust and particles of powdered metal are
easily ignited, and atmosphere which contains these contaminants can become
dangerously explosive.

remotely operated charge that causes the bolt to fail and release its hold.

Explosive bolts are used to allow stages of rockets to separate, and to release
droppable fuel tanks from an airplane.
explosive decompression (aircraft operation). A condition that can occur in a
pressurized aircraft when part of the structure fails and releases the pressure
inside the cabin at an explosive rate.
explosive rivet (special aircraft fastener). A type of blind rivet with a hollow
end, filled with an explosive charge, and sealed with a plastic cap. The rivet is
slipped into the prepared hole, and a rivet set containing an electric heater is held
against the head of the rivet. The heat ignites the explosive charge, and the end
of the rivet swells out, clamping the sheets tightly together.
exponent (mathematics). A number written above and to the right of a
mathematical expression, called the base. An exponent tells the number of times
the base is to be used as a factor (a part of the problem). In the expression 42, the
exponent is 2. The base 4 is to be used two times; it is to be multiplied by itself.
42 = 4 · 4 = 16.
extend. To move something to the limit of its travel. When a retractable landing
gear is moved from its retracted position to a position that allows the airplane to
land on it, the landing gear has been extended—it has been moved to the extent
of its travel.
extended operations (ETOPS). An airplane flight operation, other than an allcargo operation in an airplane with more than two engines, during which a
portion of the flight is conducted beyond the engines’ time threshold identified
in 14 CFR Part 121 or Part 135, an operation guideline that is determined using
an approved one-engine-inoperative cruise speed under standard atmospheric
conditions in still air.

adjacent side. The sum of the exterior angles of any polygon regardless of the
number of sides, is always 360°.

external combustion engine. A form of heat engine in which the fuel is burned to
release its heat energy outside the engine. A steam engine is a form of external
combustion engine. Fuel is burned outside the engine to heat water and change it
into steam. The steam is then fed into the cylinder or through the turbine of the
engine where it expands and performs work.
external load. A load carried by a helicopter outside of the aircraft itself.
External loads are normally carried by slings suspended below the helicopter. 14
CFR Part 1: “A load that is carried, or extends, outside the aircraft fuselage.”
external-load attaching. 14 CFR Part 1: “The structural components used to
attach an external load to an aircraft, including external-load containers, the
backup structure at the attachment points, and any quick-release device used to
jettison the external load.”
external tooth lock washer. A form of thin, spring-steel lock washer. The inside
of the washer fits around the bolt or screw, and the outside is notched to form
teeth, each of which is twisted. When the nut is screwed down tight against the

washer, the twisted teeth flatten out, and their spring action holds the nut tight
against the threads of the screw and prevents its backing off. An external-tooth
lock washer is also called a Type-B shakeproof lock washer.
extra-flexible control cable. Aircraft control cable made up of seven strands of
wire with each strand containing 19 individual wires. Extra-flexible cable,
normally called 7 by 19 cable, is used in all locations where the cable must pass
over a pulley.

extratropical low (meteorology). Any cyclone that is not a tropical cyclone. It
usually refers to the migratory frontal cyclones found in the middle or high
latitudes.
extreme pressure (EP) lubricant. A lubricant that reacts with iron to form iron
chlorides, sulfides, or phosphides on the surface of a steel part. These
compounds reduce wear and damage to surfaces in heavy rubbing contact. EP
lubricants are specially suited for lubricating gear trains.

fabrication. The process of assembling parts to make a complete unit or
structure.
fabric punch test (aircraft maintenance test). A maintenance test performed by a
technician to determine the condition of the fabric used to cover an aircraft. A
special spring-loaded punch with a sharp point is pressed into the fabric, and the
amount of force needed to cause the punch to make a specific size hole in the
fabric is measured. The stronger the fabric, the more force is needed to make the
hole.
A color-coded scale is used to indicate the condition of the fabric. Green means
the fabric is good, yellow means that the strength of the fabric is questionable,
and red means that the fabric is too dead to pass an airworthiness test. A fabric
punch test is not an absolute indication of the strength of the fabric, but it is
quick and accurate enough to determine the basic condition of the fabric.
fabric punch tester. A device used to determine the relative strength of the fabric
covering on an aircraft. The tester can give a general idea of the strength without
cutting a sample of the fabric or removing the finish.

repair, when properly done, must restore the strength and tautness the fabric had
before it was damaged.
fabric test (balloon fabric). A test of the envelope fabric for tensile strength, tear
strength, and/or porosity. Fabric tests are specified by each balloon
manufacturer.
face (propeller nomenclature). The surface of a propeller that strikes the air first
as the propeller rotates. The face of a propeller corresponds to the bottom of an
airplane wing.

faceplate (lathe component). A heavy steel disk mounted on and turned by the
headstock of a metalworking lathe. Work to be turned on the lathe can be
mounted on the faceplate.
face shield. A transparent shield used to cover your face when working with
anything that could get into your eyes or with anything that could damage your
face. Face shields are made of transparent plastic and are attached to a band
worn around your head. Face shields should be worn when working with metalcutting tools that are likely to throw chips, when using a grinding wheel, and
when servicing an air conditioning system with liquid refrigerant.
face-to-face bearing installation. Ball bearings designed to take thrust loads that
are applied to a shaft in both directions. Two sets of bearings are installed on the
shaft in such a way that one set carries thrust loads in one direction, and the
other set carries the loads in the opposite direction.
fading (radio reception). The decrease in strength of a received radio signal.
facsimile. A means of communications in which a graphic document is scanned
and the image converted into digital data which is transmitted over telephone
lines or by radio waves. At the receiving end, the data is processed in a printer,
and a paper copy of the original document is produced.
factor of safety (aircraft structure). The ratio of the breaking strength of a
structure to the maximum load that will ever be applied to it. If a structure is
designed to carry a load of 2,000 pounds, but there will never be a load of more
than 1,000 pounds applied to it, the structure has a factor of safety of two.
FAD (fuel advisory departure). Procedures used to minimize engine running
time for aircraft destined for an airport experiencing prolonged arrival delays.
FADEC (full-authority digital electronic control). A digital electronic fuel
control for a gas turbine engine that functions during all engine operations,
hence “full-authority.” It includes the electronic engine control (See EEC),
functions with the flight management computer (See FMC), and schedules the
fuel to the nozzles in such a way that prevents overshooting of power changes
and over-temperature conditions. FADEC furnishes information to the engine
instrument and crew alerting system (See EICAS).
fading of brakes. The decrease in the amount of braking action that occurs with
some types of brakes that are applied for a long period of time. True fading

occurs with overheated drum-type brakes. As the drum is heated, it expands in a
bell-mouthed fashion. This decreases the amount of drum in contact with the
brake shoes and decreases the braking action.
A condition similar to brake fading occurs when there is an internal leak in the
brake master cylinder. The brakes are applied, but as the pedal is held down,
fluid leaks past the piston, and the brakes slowly release.
FAF. See final approach fix.
Fahnstock clip (electrical connector). A type of spring clip used to temporarily
connect a wire into an electrical circuit. Some batteries have Fahnstock clips for
connecting wires to their terminals.
Fahrenheit temperature. Temperature measured on a scale that uses 32° as the
point at which pure water freezes, and 212° as the point at which pure water
boils under standard atmospheric pressure. There are 180 equal graduations
between the freezing and boiling points of water. Absolute zero (the point at
which molecular motion stops) is −460°F.
faildown. The substitute display or backup instrument mode available if the
primary component fails. For example, in some systems the multi-function
display (MFD) can substitute for the primary flight display (PFD) if the PFD
fails. The PFD information “fails down” to the MFD. In other systems, the
substitute for the PFD might be the conventional standby instruments and the
standby or secondary navigation CDI.
fail-hardover (automatic flight control malfunction). A type of failure of an
automatic flight control system that produces a steady signal which drives the
controls to the extreme end of their travel and holds them there. Hardover failure
can result in a crash, and to prevent it, automatic flight control systems have
some method of releasing or overpowering the control if such a condition
occurs.
fail-safe control. A type of control that automatically puts the controlled device
in a safe condition if the control system should fail.
faired curve. A smooth curve that has no sharp changes in its direction.

smooth surface or a smooth junction where two surfaces join.
fairlead (aircraft control system). A plastic or wooden guide used to prevent a

steel control cable from rubbing against an aircraft structure.
fall wind (meteorology). A cold wind blowing downslope. Fall wind differs from
a foehn (See foehn) in that the air is initially cold enough to remain relatively
cold despite the heating from the compression it received during its descent.
false horizon. Inaccurate visual information for aligning the aircraft caused by
various natural and geometric formations that disorient the pilot from the actual
horizon.
false lift. See uncontrolled lift.
false rib (airplane structural component). A short, partial rib used in a truss-type
airplane wing to improve the shape of the leading edge of the airfoil. False ribs,
also known as nose ribs, extend back only as far as the front spar.
false spar. A short, partial wing spar behind the rear spar, used to support the
aileron hinges.
false start (gas turbine engine operation). A condition in which the fuel-air
mixture inside a gas turbine engine ignites and burns, but the RPM does not
build up high enough for the engine to continue to run without help from the
starter. A false start, also called a hung start, is caused by the starter not turning
the engine fast enough for it to start properly.
fan blade shingling (turbofan engine damage). A type of damage in which the
midspan shrouds on the fan blades overlap, shingle fashion, rather than touching
with face-to-face contact. Fan blade shingling is caused by a sudden stoppage of
the fan, or by an overspeed condition.
fan-in (digital electronic circuit). The number of inputs connected to a single
digital logic circuit.
fan marker (electronic navigation equipment). A highly directional radio signal
transmitted vertically upward from a transmitter located along a navigational
radio range. The output of the fan marker is heard only when the aircraft is
directly above the transmitter, and this allows the pilot to know his exact
location.
fan-out (digital electronic circuit). The number of parallel loads connected to a
single logic circuit.
fan pressure ratio (turbofan engine parameter). The ratio of the fan discharge

pressure to the fan inlet pressure.
FAP (final approach point) (air traffic control). The point, applicable only to a
nonprecision approach with no depicted FAF (such as an on-airport VOR),
where the aircraft is established inbound on the final approach course from the
procedure turn, and where the final approach descent may be commenced. The
final approach point serves as the final approach fix and identifies the beginning
of the final approach segment.
FAR (Federal Aviation Regulations). Regulations established by the Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA), which govern the operation of aircraft, airways,
and airmen. Compliance with FARs is mandatory. When directly referencing
individual parts and sections of the FARs, the designation “14 CFR” is used,
which stands for “Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations.”
farad (electrical unit). The basic unit of capacitance. One farad is the amount of
capacitance that allows a charge of one coulomb to be stored under a pressure of
one volt. The farad is too large for most practical circuits, so the microfarad (one
millionth of a farad) and the picofarad (one millionth of a millionth of a farad)
are the most generally used values of capacitance.
Faraday’s law of electrolysis. The amount of any substance dissolved or
deposited in electrolysis is proportional to the total electrical charge passed.
Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction. The electromotive force induced in
a circuit by a changing magnetic field is determined by the rate of change of the
magnetic flux linking the circuit.

flight plan is tape recorded and transcribed for transmission to the appropriate air
traffic control facility.
fatal injury. Any injury that results in death within 30 days of the accident.
fatigue (metal condition). A condition existing in a metal which causes it to lose
some of its strength. Fatigue occurs when the metal is subjected to a series of
stress reversals, such as happens when the metal is repeatedly bent back and
forth.
fatigue crack (metal failure). A crack caused by stress reversals in a piece of
metal. Vibration is one of the main sources of the stress reversals that cause
fatigue cracks.

withstand for a given number of cycles before failure occurs.
FATO. See Final Approach and Takeoff Area.
fault (electrical circuit defect). Typical faults are: an open circuit (a broken
wire), a short circuit (an uninsulated portion of the wire making a connection it
should not make), or a grounded circuit (a connection made to ground where
there should be no connection).
faying surface (sheet metal structure). The portion of a lap joint in a sheet metal
structure where two sheets of metal overlap. Moisture can be trapped in the
faying surface, and it can cause corrosion if this area is not adequately protected.

FCC (Federal Communications Commission). A governmental board whose
responsibility is the regulation of all interstate electrical communications and all
foreign electrical communications that originate in the United States. The FCC is
made up of seven commissioners appointed by the President of the United
States, under the Communications Act of 1934.

(see AFCS) that has inputs from the aircraft control surfaces and the engine

controls, and outputs to the engine indicating and crew alerting system (see
EICAS) and the flight management computer (see FMC).

FDC NOTAM. A flight data center (FDC) notice to airmen (NOTAM) that is
regulatory in nature and published every 28 days in the Notices to Airmen
Publication (NTAP) by the United States NOTAM office (USNOF). FDC
NOTAMs are considered regulatory because they deal with airspace, airways,
instrument approach procedures, and aeronautical charts. See also NOTAM.
FDI. See Flight Director Indicator.
FDR (flight data recorder). A sealed recording instrument installed in transport
aircraft that makes a continuous record of the flight altitude, airspeed, heading,
accelerations, and voices and noises heard on the flight deck. The flight recorder,
called a “black box,” is installed in a fireproof housing and is mounted in the tail
of the aircraft where it is least likely to be destroyed in a crash.
feather (helicopter rotor blade movement). Rotation of a helicopter rotor blade
about its pitch-change axis.
featheredge. A thin, sharp edge on a piece of material, left as the material is
worn away by abrasion.

feathering (helicopter rotor blade). The action which changes the pitch angle of
helicopter rotor blades by rotating them about their feathering axis.
feathering axis (helicopter rotor blade). The axis about which the pitch angle of a
rotor blade is varied. The feathering axis is the same as the spanwise axis.
feathering propeller (aircraft propeller). A propeller whose blades can be moved
to an extremely high pitch angle of approximately 90° so they face directly into
the airstream and produce no aerodynamic forces. If an engine fails in flight, the

aerodynamic forces acting on the propeller will cause it to continue to turn, or
windmill.
A windmilling propeller produces enough drag on a multiengine aircraft to
cause extreme control difficulties, and it can easily lead to a crash. To decrease
the drag, the propeller blades can be feathered. Because a feathered propeller
does not turn the engine, a damaged engine is prevented from destroying itself.
feathering solenoid (propeller control). A solenoid switch used to initiate
feathering of a Hydromatic propeller. Momentarily depressing the feathering
switch energizes the feathering solenoid which allows current to flow to the
feathering pump motor until the propeller is completely feathered.
feathering switch (Hamilton Standard Hydromatic propeller component). A
locking, solenoid-operated switch used in the feather-motor circuit for a
Hydromatic propeller. When the feathering switch button is momentarily
depressed, a holding coil holds the switch closed until the feathering pump sends
enough oil into the propeller dome to feather the blades. The pump continues to
build up oil pressure until a cutout switch in the governor opens the circuit for
the holding coil. The switch then opens the circuit and the feathering pump stops
running.
federal airway. (1) Airspace corridor based on a centerline that extends from one
NAVAID intersection to another. Federal airways are 4 miles each side of the
centerline. (2) Class E airspace areas that extend upward from 1,200 feet to, but
not including, 18,000 feet MSL, unless otherwise specified.

routinely take place, that is owned and operated by the government of the United
States.”
feedback. A process in an electrical circuit or control system in which some
energy from the output of the system or circuit is fed back into the input. If the

energy being fed back is in phase with the input signal, the feedback is positive
and the output is increased. But if it is fed back out of phase with the input
signal, the feedback is negative and the output is decreased. A control system
using feedback is called a closed-loop system. The feedback closes the loop.
feeder facilities. NAVAIDs used by ATC to direct aircraft to intervening fixes
between the enroute structure and the initial approach fix.
feeder fix (air traffic control). The fix depicted on instrument approach
procedure charts which establishes the starting point of a feeder route.
feeder route (air traffic control). A route depicted on instrument approach
procedure charts to designate routes for aircraft to proceed from the enroute
structure to the initial approach fix (IAF).
feedthrough capacitor. A capacitor used to carry a conductor through a panel or
bulkhead. The outer conductor of the capacitor is connected to the case, and the
inner conductor is connected to terminals that extend from both ends of the
capacitor. Feedthrough capacitors used in some aircraft magnetos minimize
breaker point arcing and also decrease the radio interference caused by electrical
energy radiated from the ignition switch lead.
feedthrough connector. A type of electrical connector used to carry a group of
conductors through a bulkhead or panel. Feedthrough connectors do not have
wires fastened to them, but rather they allow cables on both sides of the
bulkhead to be connected through them. Sealed feedthrough connectors carry
circuits through the bulkheads of pressurized aircraft.
feeler gage (precision tool). A type of measuring tool consisting of strips of
precision-ground steel of accurately measured thickness. Feeler gages are used
to measure the distance between close-fitting parts, such as the clearances in a
mechanical system or the distance by which moving contacts are separated.
fence (aerodynamics). A stationary vane that extends chordwise, from the
leading edge to the trailing edge, across upper surface of the wing of a highspeed airplane. Fences prevent the air from flowing spanwise along the wing.
Fenestron tail rotor (helicopter component). A shrouded tail rotor that has a
number of small blades rotating in a protective shroud. A Fenestron rotor is more
effective than a conventional tail rotor because its shroud aids in directing the air
through the blades and it protects the rotor and ground personnel from damage.

Fenwal fire detection system. A patented spot-type fire detection system
installed in an aircraft. This system uses individual thermal switches connected
between two insulated conductors. An open circuit in either of the two
conductors will not prevent the system from detecting a fire, but it will keep it
from indicating good when the test switch is closed.
fermium. A synthetic, metallic, radioactive chemical element. Fermium’s
symbol is Fm, its atomic number is 100, and it has mass numbers ranging
between 248 and 257. Fermium was first discovered as debris from a hydrogen
bomb explosion, and it is now made in nuclear reactors.
ferrite. A material used as a core for many electromagnetic components. Ferrite
is made of powdered metal sintered and molded into the proper shape. Sintering
is a process in which powdered metal is heated but not quite melted, and then
squeezed together. Ferrite has a high permeability, it easily accepts lines of
magnetic flux, but it has such a high resistance that eddy current losses are very
low.
ferrite steel. Alpha iron into which some carbon has been dissolved. It exists at
temperatures below its critical temperature.
ferromagnetic material. A material that contains iron and has a high magnetic
permeability. Ferromagnetic materials can be magnetically saturated (all the
magnetic domains aligned in the same direction). They have good retentivity;
they retain a large amount of their magnetism when the magnetizing force is
removed.
ferrous metal. Any metal that contains iron and has magnetic characteristics.

Administration that allows an unlicensed aircraft to be flown from its present
location to another location where it can be repaired, inspected, or otherwise
prepared for licensing.
FET (field effect transistor). A high-impedance semiconductor device in which
the flow of load current between the source and drain is controlled by variations
in voltage on the gate, rather than current, as is done with a bipolar transistor.
Load current flowing between the source and the drain, through a
semiconductor channel, is switched and regulated by the effect of an electric
field exerted by the voltage on the gate. An FET is sometimes called a unipolar
transistor.

of strong, lightweight structural components. The glass fibers have diameters
between 0.005 mm and 0.2 mm (0.0002 inch and 0.008 inch).
fiber locknut (self-locking nut). A type of self-locking nut used on a bolt that is
subject to vibration—it cannot, however, be used on a bolt that is subject to
rotation. A collar of resilient, or springy, fiber is locked into the end of the
threads in the nut. The hole in the fiber is slightly smaller than the major
diameter of the threads on the bolt on which it fits. When the nut is screwed onto
the bolt, the threads press, but do not cut, into the fiber and cause so much
friction that the nut cannot vibrate loose from the bolt. A fiber locknut can be
reused as long as a wrench is needed to turn it onto the bolt.
fiber optics. The branch of technology that deals with the transmission of light
through long, slender, flexible fibers of glass or transparent plastic material.
Transparent fibers arranged in a compact bundle have the ability to transmit an
image from one end to the other, even if the bundle is bent around a corner.
Fiber optic borescopes are used to inspect the inside of a structure without
requiring any major disassembly. These instruments may be fitted with a light
source to illuminate the inside of the device being inspected, and a camera to
make a permanent record of what is seen through the eyepiece.
FICON NOTAM. A field condition (FICON) NOTAM is used to report surface

an emulsion-type cleaner, followed by a rinse with distilled or demineralized
water. Field cleaning is done while the engine is motored by the starter or
operated at a low RPM.
field coil (electrical machine). A coil of insulated wire wound around a
laminated steel pole shoe in an electrical motor or generator. Each motor or
generator has two or more field coils that may be connected either in parallel or
in series with the armature.
Direct current flowing through the field coils of a generator produces magnetic
flux which induces a voltage in the conductors of the armature as they pass in
front of the pole shoes. The amount of voltage induced in the armature is
determined by the strength of the magnetic field. A voltage regulator is normally
used to control the amount of current flowing in the field coils, and thus the
strength of the magnetic field.
In a motor, torque is produced by the reaction between the magnetic flux
produced by current flowing in the field coils and the flux produced by current
flowing through the armature coils.
field effect transistor. See FET.
field elevation. The highest point of an airport’s usable runways measured in feet
from mean sea level.
field excitation (aircraft generator). Direct current supplied to the field coils of a
generator to produce the magnetic field in which the armature rotates. DC
generators are normally self-excited. This means that the field excitation current
comes directly from the armature. Self-excited generators depend upon residual
magnetism in the field frame to produce the initial excitation current as soon as
the generator begins to turn.
field frame (generator component). The steel housing of a generator in which the
field coils are mounted. The field frame provides a low reluctance path for the
magnetic flux from the field coils, and it retains enough magnetism, when the
generator is not operating, to start the generator producing current. This
magnetism is called residual magnetism.

field kit. Tools, materials, and equipment that allow operators to complete
regular repairs and maintenance while in the field.

is a small piece of flat resistance wire mounted inside a tube-like cathode.
Electrons flowing through the filament cause it to glow red-hot, and this heats
the cathode. The heat speeds up the molecular movement in the cathode enough
that electrons are emitted from its surface. Electron tube filaments are heated
with low-voltage AC or with low-voltage batteries.
file (air traffic control). Used in conjunction with flight plans to indicate that a
flight plan has been submitted to ATC.
file (metal-cutting tool). A handheld cutting tool used to remove a small amount
of metal by pushing the tool across the metal surface. A file is made of very

hard, high-carbon steel, and has rows of teeth cut across its face at an angle to
the length of the file.
Files with a single set of teeth are called single-cut files, and a file having a
second set of teeth that cross the first set is called a double-cut file. The teeth on
a file vary from very fine to coarse. A file with the finest teeth is said to have a
dead-smooth cut; next in coarseness is a smooth cut, then a second cut, a bastard
cut, and finally a coarse cut.

route of a flight which requires special flight plan filing and handling techniques.
Filed enroute delays may be terminal area delays, special use airspace delays, or
aerial refueling delays.

the pilot or his/her designated representative without any subsequent changes or
clearances.
filiform corrosion. A thread-, or filament-like corrosion which forms on
aluminum skins beneath a dense paint film. Filiform corrosion gets its name
from the fact that it grows in shape of a thread, or a filament.
filler material (plastic resin component). A material mixed into a plastic resin to
give body to the resin. Powdered chalk and microballoons are two commonly
used filler materials.
filler neck (fluid reservoir component). A cylindrical tube extending from a fluid
reservoir to a location that is convenient to fill the reservoir. Some hydraulic
reservoirs and fuel tanks are installed inside an aircraft structure in a location
where servicing is difficult. A filler neck is installed on these reservoirs to allow
them to be filled from outside the aircraft.
filler plug (flush-skin repair component). A plug of sheet metal installed in a
flush-skin repair to bring the surface of the repair even with the skin being
repaired. The strength of the repair is in the doubler inside the structure, and the
filler plug is used only to make the surface aerodynamically smooth.

filler rods (welding). Long pieces of wire that are melted into a weld to provide
additional material to strengthen the weld. Filler rods are usually called welding
rods.
filler valve (oxygen system component). A valve in an oxygen system through
which oxygen from the storage bottles is put into the system. Filler valves
normally incorporate a restriction that prevents the system from being filled too
quickly. If they were filled too quickly, enough heat could be built up to cause
an explosion.
fillet (aircraft structure). A fairing used to give shape, but not strength, to an
object. A fillet produces a smooth junction where two surfaces meet. Fillets are
often used to produce a smooth, aerodynamically clean junction between the
wing and the fuselage of an airplane.
filling (meteorology). An increase in the central pressure of a meteorological
pressure system. Filling, which is the opposite of deepening, is more commonly
applied to a low, rather than a high.

sides, and a flat bearing surface. Fillister-head screws often have holes drilled
through the head so they can be safetied with safety wire.

parallel with the output of a DC power supply. The capacitor has a low
impedance for any ripple that may be superimposed on the DC output, and the
ripple is passed to ground, while the DC is not affected.

filter choke (electronic component). An iron-core inductor installed in series
with the output of a DC power supply. The filter choke impedes, or opposes, any
ripples or portions of alternating current that are superimposed on the DC output.

equipped with the controller-alert system hardware/software which is used in the
precision runway monitor (PRM) system. The display includes alert algorithms
providing the target predictors, a color-change alert when a target penetrates or

diameter. In a helicopter rotor it is the thickness of the airfoil as a percentage of
its chord length.

fine-wire spark plug (aircraft reciprocating engine component). A type of spark
plug used in aircraft engines that have problems with lead fouling the plugs. The
electrodes are made of small-diameter platinum or iridium wire which leaves the
firing end of the spark plug open so the gases inside the cylinder can scavenge
the lead compounds before they solidify and foul the plug.

finger brake (sheet metal shop tool). Another term for a box brake. See box

area, or the wheel wells.
fire extinguisher. A device, either handheld or installed in an aircraft, that directs
a fire extinguishing agent onto a fire.
fire extinguishing agent. A chemical used to extinguish a fire. A fire
extinguishing agent can extinguish a fire by reducing the temperature of the fuel
to a value below its kindling point, by excluding oxygen from the fire, or by
preventing the oxygen combining with the fuel. Carbon dioxide, water, Halon
1211, and Halon 1301 are fire extinguishing agents used in aircraft fire
protection systems.
fire point (chemical characteristic). The lowest temperature at which the fumes
of a volatile liquid (a liquid that evaporates easily) will ignite and continue to
burn when a small flame is passed above its surface.

(2) With respect to other materials and parts, means the capacity to withstand
the heat associated with fire at least as well as steel in dimensions
appropriate for the purpose for which they are used.”
fireproof structure. A structure built of noncombustible materials and designed
so it cannot be destroyed by fire.
fire-pull handle. The handle in an aircraft cockpit that is pulled at the first
indication of an engine fire. Pulling this handle disconnects the generator from
the electrical system, shuts off the fuel and hydraulic fluid to the engine, and
closes the compressor bleed air valve. The fire extinguisher agent discharge
switch is uncovered, but it is not automatically closed.
fire resistant. 14 CFR Part 1:
“(1) With respect to sheet or structural members means the capacity to
withstand the heat associated with fire at least as well as aluminum alloy in
dimensions appropriate for the purpose for which they are used; and
(2) With respect to fluid-carrying lines, fluid system parts, wiring, air ducts,

fittings, and powerplant controls, means the capacity to perform the intended
functions under the heat and other conditions likely to occur when there is a
fire at the place concerned.”
fire-resistant structure. A structure that is able to resist fire or exposure to high
temperature for a specified period of time without being destroyed or structurally
damaged.
fire sleeve. A protective covering wrapped around flexible hoses installed in the
engine compartments of an aircraft. A fire sleeve does not increase the service
temperature of the hose, but it protects the hose from direct fire long enough to
allow appropriate action to be taken.
fire triangle. A graphic display of the three components that must be present for
a fire. These components are: fuel, oxygen, and heat.

firewall (aircraft structural component). A bulkhead made of a fireproof material
used to separate the engine compartment from the rest of the aircraft.

the weight. The force and the weight try to rotate the lever in opposite directions.

first gust (meteorology). The leading edge of a spreading downdraft, called a
plow wind, in front of an approaching thunderstorm.
fir-tree attachment. A method of attaching turbine blades into the turbine wheel.
The root of the blade is shaped like a notched-edge Christmas tree which fits
loosely in a similar-shaped slot in the periphery of the wheel. When the engine is
cold, the blades are loose, but as the engine heats up, the blades tighten in the
wheel.
fisheyes (finishing system defect). A type of finishing system defect in which
small, local areas of the finish do not cure properly. These small areas resemble
the eyes of a fish.
Fisheyes are caused by small specks of wax or silicone material on the surface
when the finish was sprayed on, or by contaminants that fell on the finish before
it cured.
fishmouth splice (welded tubular structure). A type of splice used in a welded
steel tubular structure, in which the end of a tube, whose inside diameter is the
same as the outside diameter of the tube being spliced, is cut in the shape of a V,
or fishmouth, and is slipped over the smaller tube and welded. A fishmouth
splice has more weld area than a butt splice, and it allows the stresses from one
tube to transfer gradually into the other tube.
fission. See nuclear fission.
fishtail (aircraft flight maneuver). A method of decreasing the speed of an
airplane during its approach for landing. Airplanes without flaps can be slowed
down and kept on a relatively straight flight path by alternately skidding the

airplane to the left and then to the right, by using the rudder while keeping the
wings level with the control stick or wheel. Side and forward slips are used more
often than fishtailing for slowing an airplane.
fitting. An attachment device that is used to connect components to an aircraft
structure.
five-hour rating (battery capacity rating). The ampere-hour rating of a battery
when current is taken from it at a rate that will discharge it in five hours. A 20ampere-hour battery will supply four amps of current for five hours, but if it is
discharged at a higher rate, its ampere-hour capacity will be less. The five-hour
rating is the rating most generally used for aircraft storage batteries.
five-minute rating (battery capacity rating). The ampere-hour rating of a battery
when current is taken from it at such a high rate that the battery will be
discharged in five minutes. The high current drawn from a battery causes the
ampere-hour capacity to be much less at its five-minute rating than it is at its
five-hour rating. The five-minute rating gives an indication of the way the
battery will respond under the load placed on it by the engine starter.
fix (aircraft navigation). A geographical position determined by visual references
to the surface, by reference to one or more radio NAVAIDs, by celestial plotting,
or by other navigational methods.
fixation. A psychological condition in which the pilot fixes attention on a single

aircraft.
fixed landing gear (aircraft landing gear). A nonretractable landing gear. A fixed
landing gear cannot be retracted into the aircraft structure to decrease the wind
resistance.
fixed-pitch propeller (aircraft propeller). A type of propeller used on aircraft
when low cost and simplicity are more important than efficient performance.
The blades of a fixed-pitch propeller are set at one pitch angle which cannot be
changed. Up through World War II, most fixed-pitch propellers were made of

laminated birch, but since that time, most have been made of forged aluminum
alloy.
The pitch angle of a fixed-pitch propeller is a compromise between that which
allows the engine to turn fast enough to produce the maximum horsepower for
takeoff, and that which moves the aircraft through the air a maximum distance
for each revolution, giving the best fuel economy and speed.
fixed shaft turboprop engine. A turboprop engine in which the gas producer
spool is directly connected to the output shaft.
fixed slot (high-lift device). A fixed, nozzle-shaped opening near the leading
edge of a wing that ducts air onto the top surface of the wing. Its purpose is to
allow flight at a higher angle of attack before a stall occurs.

excluding each crewmember seat; or (3) an airplane with a payload capacity of
more than 7,500 pounds, when operating at locations as defined in 14 CFR
§110.2. These locations are defined as: (1) between any point within the State of
Alaska or the State of Hawaii or any territory or possession of the United States
and any point outside the State of Alaska or the State of Hawaii or any territory

or possession of the United States, respectively; (2) between any point within the
48 contiguous states of the U.S. or the District of Columbia and any point
outside the 48 contiguous states of the U.S. and the District of Columbia; or (3)
between any point outside the U.S. and another point outside the U.S.
flameout (gas turbine engine operation). A condition in the operation of a gas
turbine engine in which the fire in the engine unintentionally goes out. If too
much fuel is sprayed into the combustors, the fire will go out, and this is called a
rich flameout. If there is too little fuel, the fire will go out, and this is called a
lean flameout.
flameout pattern (air traffic control). An approach normally conducted by a
single-engine military aircraft experiencing loss or anticipated loss of engine
power or control. The standard overhead approach starts at a relatively high
altitude over a runway (high key) followed by a continuous 180° turn to a high,
wide position (low key), followed by a continuous 180° turn to final. The
standard straight-in pattern starts at a point that results in a straight-in approach
with a high rate of descent to the runway. Flameout approaches terminate in the
type of approach requested by the pilot (normally full stop).
flameout, simulated. A practice approach by a jet aircraft (normally military) at
idle thrust to a runway. The approach may start at a runway (high key) and may
continue on a relatively high and wide downwind leg with a continuous turn to
final. It terminates in landing or low approach.
flame resistant. 14 CFR Part 1: “Not susceptible to combustion to the point of
propagating a flame, beyond safe limits, after the ignition source is removed.”
flame spraying. A process in which molten metal is deposited on a surface. A
wire of the metal to be deposited is fed into an oxy-acetylene flame and melted.
The molten metal is blown by a stream of high-pressure air onto the surface to
be coated.
Pure aluminum can be sprayed onto steel to prevent corrosion, and metal can
be sprayed onto an insulating material to make the surface electrically
conductive.
flame tubes (turbine engine component). Small-diameter metal tubes that
connect can-type combustors to carry the ignition flame to all of the combustion
chambers.
flammable. Easily ignited. Flammable replaces the older term inflammable

which can be misinterpreted to mean not flammable. 14 CFR Part 1: “With
respect to a fluid or gas, means susceptible to igniting readily or to exploding.”
flammable liquid. A liquid that gives off combustible vapors (vapors that are
easily ignited). Gasoline is an example of a flammable liquid.
flange. A ridge that protrudes from a device and is used for attaching something
to the device, or for connecting two objects together. The propeller shaft of most
modern aircraft engines is fitted with a flange on which the propeller mounts.
The end of the propeller shaft is formed into a flat plate (the flange) whose face
is perpendicular the propeller shaft. The propeller is held on this flange with
high-strength steel bolts.

flap (helicopter rotor blade movement). Up-and-down movement of the tip of a
helicopter rotor blade.
flaperon (aircraft control). Controls used on some swept wing airplanes that
serve as both ailerons and wing flaps. The flaperons on both wings can be
lowered together to increase the lift and drag of the wings. This is the flap
function. The flaperons can also be moved differentially: one moves up, while
the other moves down. This is the aileron function.
flap extended speed. 14 CFR Part 1: “The highest speed permissible with wing
flaps in a prescribed extended position.”
flap overload valve. A valve in the flap system of an airplane that prevents the
flaps being lowered at an airspeed which could cause structural damage. If the
pilot tries to extend the flaps when the airspeed is too high, the opposition

caused by the airflow will open the overload valve and return the fluid to the
reservoir.
flapper valve. A form of hinged check valve that allows fluid to flow through it
in one direction only. Fluid can flow in the direction which forces the valve off
its seat, but it cannot flow in the direction which forces the flapper against its
seat.
flapping (helicopter rotor blade). The vertical movement of a helicopter rotor
blade about its delta, or flapping, hinge.
flapping hinge (helicopter rotor). The hinge with its axis parallel to the rotor
plane of rotation. The flapping hinge permits the rotor blades to flap up or down
to equalize the lift, or rotor thrust, between the advancing-blade half and the
retreating-blade half of the rotor disk.
flaps (airplane control surfaces). Auxiliary controls built into the wings of an
airplane. Flaps can be extended, or lowered, to change the airfoil shape of the
wing to increase both its lift and drag. When the flaps are fully extended, the
drag is increased so the airplane can descend at a steep angle without building up
excessive airspeed. Partially lowering the flaps increases the lift so the airplane
can fly at a slower airspeed. See plain flap, split flap, slotted flap, Fowler flap,
and triple-slotted flap.
flare (aircraft flight maneuver). The last flight maneuver made by an airplane in
a successful landing. The airplane is slowed down in preparation for landing, and
it descends along a gradually sloping flight path that brings it to the end of the
runway. When the airplane is over the end of the runway, just a few feet above
the surface, the pilot flares by gently pulling back on the control wheel.
Flaring increases the angle of attack and allows the airplane to settle onto the
runway with the slowest forward speed and the least vertical speed. Flaring is
sometimes called rounding out.
flare (aircraft safety equipment). A safety device that was at one time carried in
most airplanes that flew at night. A flare is a magnesium candle supported by a
small parachute. If it was necessary for an airplane to make an emergency
landing at night, the pilot released a flare, and as it left the airplane, it
automatically ignited. The burning magnesium made a bright light that allowed
the pilot to see the ground and make a reasonably safe landing. The parachute

lowered the flare slowly enough that it was completely burned out before it
reached the ground.
flare (rigid fluid lines). A cone-shaped expansion on the end of a piece of rigid
fluid line tubing. The fitting to which the flared tubing attaches has a coneshaped end that exactly mates with the flare, and when the tubing nut is
tightened onto the fitting, the flare and the flare cone form a fluid-tight seal.
Tubing used in automotive fluid lines is flared at an angle of 45°, and tubing
used in aircraft fluid lines is flared at an angle of 37°.
flare guidance (electronic display). Sub-system that provides explicit command
guidance for the pilot to flare the aircraft.
flare prompt (electronic display). The flare prompt advises the pilot when it is
time to begin making the control inputs for the flare maneuver and transition to
landing. It is only designed for the start of this process and does not provide
command guidance for maneuvering the airplane with regard to the rate or
magnitude of manual inputs, alignment to runway heading, or touching down at
a specific point on the runway.
flareless fitting (fluid lines). A type of fitting used on a fluid line that forms its
seal without being flared. Flareless fittings use a compression sleeve around the
end of the tube. The sleeve fits into a recess in the fitting, and when the nut is
tightened, the sleeve is forced tightly between the tube and the fitting, making a
fluid-tight seal.
flaring block (maintenance tool). A hinged double bar with holes corresponding
to the outside diameter of various sizes of tubing. These holes are countersunk
with a 37° taper (45° for automotive flares) to form the outside support against
which the flare is formed. The tube is inserted in the correct hole and the bars
clamped together. A flaring cone is forced into the end of the tube to form the
flare.
flashback (welding problem). A problem in oxy-gas welding in which the flame
burns back into the mixing chamber of the torch. A clogged or overheated tip
can cause the flame to disappear from the tip and burn back into the mixing
chamber.
A flashback is always accompanied by a shrill hissing or squealing, and the
flame does not reappear at the tip as it does with a backfire. Flashback is
extremely dangerous, and if the fuel gas, the acetylene or hydrogen, is not turned

off at the regulator, the fire can burn back through the hose and cause an
explosion.
flasher (electric lights). An automatic switch installed in a light system to turn
the lights on and off in a definite sequence. Flashers may be operated by a
thermal switch, or they may have a motor that drives a selector switch.
In a thermally operated switch, the current used in the lights passes through a
strip of bimetallic material and heats it. When the strip gets hot, it warps and
separates the contacts, opening the circuit. Current stops flowing, and the lights
go out. When the strip cools, it snaps back to its original shape and closes the
contacts, and the lights turn back on.
flashing off (finishing system). A step in the curing process of a finishing
system. The finishing material is thinned with a solvent to get the proper
viscosity for spraying. When the finish is sprayed on the surface, it is shiny
because of the solvents. These solvents evaporate very soon and leave the
surface of the finish dry to the touch, but it is not completely cured. The
evaporation of the thinning solvents is called flashing off.
flashing the field (generator maintenance). A maintenance procedure for an
aircraft generator that restores residual magnetism to the field frame. DC
generators get their field excitation current from the armature, and the field
frame must retain a small amount of permanent magnetism to furnish the
magnetic field to begin producing current in the armature. As soon as current
begins to flow in the armature, it excites the field.
If the field frame loses its residual magnetism, it must be restored before the
generator can produce current. This residual magnetism is restored by flashing
the field. A battery is momentarily connected to the field coil so current flows
through it in its normal direction for a few seconds. This current magnetizes the
field frame.
flash line (molded products). The raised line along the surface of a molded part
caused by the molten material flowing into the space formed by the slightly
rounded edges of the two halves of the mold.
flashover (reciprocating engine ignition system fault). An ignition system
problem in which the high voltage in the magneto distributor jumps to the wrong
terminal. Flashover causes the wrong spark plug to fire, and this reduces the
engine power and produces vibration and excessive heat.
Flashover is often caused by moisture inside the distributor, but it also occurs

when flying at high altitude where the air inside the distributor does not have
enough density to act as an effective dielectric. Physically large distributors,
low-tension ignition systems, and pressurized distributors have been used to
prevent flashover.
flash plating (metal finishing). The deposit of an extremely thin coating of metal
on a surface. A flash coating is only thick enough to give color to the surface.
flash point (petroleum specification). The temperature to which a material must
be raised for it to ignite, but not continue to burn, when a flame is passed above
it.
flash resistant. 14 CFR Part 1: “Not susceptible to burning violently when
ignited.”
flat-compounded generator. A compound-wound generator (a generator that has
both a series and a parallel, or shunt, winding) in which the effect of the two
fields are balanced so they hold the output voltage constant from a no-load
condition to the maximum load the generator can produce. See overcompounded
generator and undercompounded generator.
flat file (metal-cutting hand tool). A common type of file used to smooth the
edges or surface of a piece of metal or hard plastic. A flat file is tapered toward
the tip in width and slightly tapered in thickness. It has two sets of teeth arranged
diagonally across the surface in opposite directions (double cut), on both sides
and a single row of teeth along both edges.

for each flat surface, and for all of the bends marked out with bend-tangent lines
drawn between the flats and bend allowances.

flat pitch. A propeller configuration in which the blade chord is aligned with the
direction of rotation.
flat-rated engine. A turboprop engine whose allowable output power is less than
the engine is physically capable of producing. Below a specific density altitude,
the engine is limited by the amount of torque the airframe can tolerate. Above
this altitude, the engine is limited by the exhaust gas temperature.
flat spin (aircraft maneuver). An aircraft maneuver in which the aircraft is
autorotating (being pulled around by aerodynamic forces) as it descends, with
one wing flying, and the other actually stalled. In a normal spin, the aircraft is

pitched steeply nose down, but since it is descending, it has a very high angle of
attack. Recovery is made by moving the control wheel forward (the elevators
down). This decreases the angle of attack and allows the stalled wing to begin
flying again, and the airplane stops spinning.
In a flat spin, the angle of attack cannot be lowered enough, even with fulldown elevators to bring the wing out of its stalled condition. Flat spins are
caused by the center of gravity of the aircraft being too far aft, allowing
centrifugal force to flatten the spin. Very few aircraft can recover from an
unintentional flat spin.
flat washer. A disk of metal with a hole in its center. A flat washer, also called a
plain washer, is used under the head of a bolt to provide a bearing surface. It can
also be used under a nut to make a surface for the nut to turn against so that it
will not dig into the material contacted by the nut.
flaw. An imperfection in a material, often concealed, that impairs soundness.
fleet weight (aircraft operation). The average weight of aircraft of the same
model that have the same equipment installed. Operations under 14 CFR Part
121 and 135 may use fleet weight, rather than having to weigh each individual
aircraft.

around a current-carrying conductor in such a way that the thumb points in the
direction of conventional current flow (from positive to negative). The fingers
encircle the wire in the same direction as the lines of flux.
Fleming’s rule for electric generators. This is the rule for determining the
direction of current flow in a wire caused by the wire passing through a magnetic
field. Hold the right hand with the thumb, first finger, and second finger
extended so that they are at right angles to each other. When the first finger
points in the direction of the lines of magnetic flux (from the north pole to the
south pole), and the thumb points in the direction the wire is moving through the
field, the second finger points in the direction of conventional current flow (from
positive to negative).
Fleming’s rule for electric motors. The rule for determining the direction of
movement of a current-carrying conductor in a magnetic field. Hold the left hand
with the thumb, first finger, and second finger extended so that they are at right
angles to each other. When the first finger points in the direction of the lines of

magnetic flux (from the north pole to the south pole), and the second finger
points in the direction of conventional current flow (from positive to negative),
the thumb points in the direction the conductor will move.

aircraft. The simulator looks like the flight deck or cockpit of a specific aircraft.
All the controls and instruments are computer driven, and they duplicate those in
the aircraft. The controls have the same feel, and the instruments give the same
indications as those in the real aircraft. Flight simulators allow many different
types of emergency situations to be simulated under safe conditions, so flight
crews will know how to respond when a real emergency occurs.

and all services provided were absorbed into Flight Service (on frequency
122.2).
flint lighter (welding equipment). A device used to light an oxy-gas welding
torch. The lighter consists of a small piece of flint that can be rubbed against a
piece of rough, hardened steel. A metal cup behind the steel prevents the flame
from reaching out and burning anything as the torch is being lit.
flip-flop (digital electronic building block). A digital building block having two
stable states, used to store information. A flip-flop is made of two cross-coupled
NAND or NOR gates that act as a latch. The output of each gate is applied to the
input of the other.

float-type carburetor. A type of carburetor used on reciprocating engines in
which the fuel-metering force is produced between a fixed fuel level and a
variable negative air pressure that is produced by a venturi. The venturi pressure
varies with the amount of air flowing into the engine. This variable fuelmetering force acting across a fixed-size jet meters the correct amount of fuel
into the air.

secondary nozzles or orifices.
flow divider (reciprocating engine component). The valve in an Precision
Airmotive RSA fuel injection system that divides the fuel from the fuel control
unit and distributes it equally to all of the cylinders. The flow divider in an RSA

cubic inches.
fluid power. The transmission of force by the movement of a fluid.
fluid power systems. Mechanical systems that transfer energy from one location
to another by the use of fluids. Hydraulic systems transfer energy by the use of

noncompressible fluids, such as oil and water. Pneumatic systems transfer
energy by the use of a compressible fluid, such as air.

frequency of visible light, stimulated in a substance by the absorption of incident
radiation and persisting only so long as the stimulating radiation is continued.
fluorescent lamp. A tubular electric lamp in which ionized mercury vapor causes
a fluorescent coating inside the tube to glow.
fluorescent penetrant inspection. A form of nondestructive inspection used to
detect surface faults in either ferrous or nonferrous metals or in nonporous,
nonmetallic materials. The part to be inspected is thoroughly cleaned and soaked
in a penetrating liquid that contains a fluorescent dye. After the part has soaked
for a specified period of time, all the penetrant is washed off its surface, and it is
dried. The part is then covered with a developer, a chalk-like powder, that pulls
the penetrant out of any cracks or faults into which it has seeped. The part is then
inspected under an ultraviolet light that causes any penetrant pulled from a fault
to show up as a bright spot or line on the surface.
fluorescent pigment. Pigment used in a paint which can absorb either visible or
nonvisible electromagnetic radiation and release it as energy of the desired
wavelength. Fluorescent pigments are used for painting pointers and numbers on
instrument dials. When ultraviolet light strikes the fluorescent pigment, the dial
and pointers glow with a highly visible light.
fluorine. A pale yellow, highly corrosive, poisonous, gaseous, halogen chemical

screen is used in place of photographic film, to display the shadows which form
when X-rays penetrate the structure being inspected.
flush patch (aircraft sheet metal repair). A type of sheet metal repair that leaves a
perfectly smooth surface. The reinforcement for the patch is mounted inside the
structure, and the hole left where the damaged material was removed is filled
with a filler plug. All rivets used for the repair are flush rivets. See illustration
for filler plug.

flush rivet. An MS20426 aircraft solid rivet that has a countersunk head. The
hole for the rivet is prepared by either countersinking or dimpling. When the

used to produce an aerodynamically smooth surface.

flute. A groove cut into a cylindrical object. A twist drill is a type of tool having
cutting edges on its end and flutes cut in the form of a spiral running the length
of the drill. Lubricant can be fed to the cutting edge through the flutes, and chips
move up through the flutes to keep the hole clean.
flutter (flight condition). Rapid and uncontrolled oscillation of a flight control
surface on an aircraft caused by a dynamically unbalanced condition. Flutter
normally causes the loss of the control surface and a crash.
flux (magnetism). Lines of magnetic flux are the same as lines of magnetic
force.
flux (soldering flux). A material used to prepare a metal so it will accept solder.
There are two basic types of flux used with soft solder: acid and resin. Muriatic
acid, a form of hydrochloric acid, is used to prepare steel for soldering. The acid
cleans the metal by removing oxides from the surface, and etches, or roughens,
the surface of the cleaned metal so the solder will stick to it.
Resin is used as a flux for soldering copper wires. The wires must be clean and
the joint mechanically sound. When the joint is heated, the resin, which melts at
a lower temperature than the solder, flows out ahead of the solder. The flux
covers the metal, preventing oxygen reaching the heated metal and forming
oxides.
Acid must never be used for soldering any type of electrical equipment because
of the difficulty of removing the acid after the soldering is completed. Unless
every trace of the acid is removed, corrosion will form.
flux density (magnetism). The number of lines of magnetic flux in a unit of area.
flux gate. See flux valve.

flux valve (earth induction compass component). A special transformer that
receives a directional signal from the earth’s magnetic field and directs it into an
amplifier and then into a gyro-stabilized compass indicator. A flux valve is also
called a flux gate.

fly-by waypoint. A fly-by waypoint requires the use of turn anticipation to avoid
overshoot of the next flight segment.
fly-by-wire (flight control system). A method of control used by some modern
aircraft in which control movement or pressures exerted by the pilot are directed
into a digital computer where they are input into a program tailored to the flight
characteristics of the aircraft. The computer output signal is sent to actuators at
the control surfaces to move them the optimum amount for the desired
maneuver.
fly cutter (hole-cutting tool). An adjustable hole cutter turned in a drill press.
The cutting tool is set so its distance from the center of the pilot drill is exactly
that needed for the radius of the hole. The pilot drill cuts the center hole, and the
cutting tool is fed very slowly into the metal. The cutting tool can be reversed in
the holder so the edge of the hole being cut will be either straight or beveled.
“Fly heading…degrees” (air traffic control). Instructions issued by ATC to a
pilot directing him to turn to and continue in a specific compass direction.
flying boat. An airplane whose fuselage is built in the form of a boat hull to
allow it to land and takeoff from water. Most flying boats have small floats
mounted out near the wing tips to support the wing when the aircraft is at rest on
the water. In the past, flying boats were a popular form of large airplane for long
distance flights, but their inefficiency caused them to become almost extinct
after the end of World War II, when there were land airports with long runways
scattered throughout the world.

flying wing. A type of heavier-than-air aircraft that has no fuselage or separate
tail surfaces. The engines and useful load are carried inside the wing, and
movable control surfaces on the trailing edge provide both pitch and roll control.
fly-over waypoint. A fly-over waypoint precludes any turn until the waypoint is
overflown and is followed by an intercept maneuver of the next flight segment.
flyweights (speed sensors). Speed sensors used in many types of governors and
speed-control devices. A typical flyweight is an L-shaped arm, pivoted at the
center, and mounted on a spinning plate. There are usually two or three
flyweights mounted on the same plate. A control rod is held against the
flyweight by a control, or speeder, spring.
When the plate is not spinning, the speeder spring holds the control rod down,
and the toes of the flyweights rest against the plate. This is called the underspeed
condition.
When the plate is spinning and the pressure of the speeder spring is weak,
centrifugal force causes the flyweights to sling out and lift the control rod. This
is called the overspeed condition.
When the centrifugal force on the flyweights exactly balances the compressive
force of the speeder spring, the flyweights stand straight up, and the control rod
is in a middle position. This is called the onspeed condition.

flywheel. A heavy wheel used to smooth the pulsations in a drive system. A
reciprocating engine delivers its power in a series of pushes as each cylinder, in
turn, goes through its power stroke. A heavy flywheel stores kinetic energy from

each power stroke and gives it back by keeping the engine turning between
power strokes. An airplane engine does not need a flywheel, because the
propeller serves the same purpose.
flywheel effect (electronic circuit). One of the characteristics of an LC circuit, a
circuit that contains both inductance and capacitance. If a class-C amplifier
supplies an LC circuit with short pulses of energy at the proper time, the
magnetic field around the inductor will build up and decay, and the capacitor
will charge and discharge.
The LC circuit acts as a flywheel, and a continuous flow of alternating current
is maintained between the inductor and capacitor, even though the energy is
supplied in short pulses. Energy stored in the electromagnetic and electrostatic
fields is supplied to the circuit during the time it is not being supplied by the
amplifier.
FM (radio modulation). See frequency modulation.
FMC (flight management computer). An electronic flight instrumentation system
that allows the flight crew to initiate and implement a given flight plan and
monitor its execution.
FMS (flight management systems) (air traffic control). A computer system that
uses a large data base to allow routes to be preprogrammed and fed into the
system by means of a data loader. The system is constantly updated with respect
to position accuracy by reference to conventional navigation aids. The
sophisticated program and its associated data base insures that the most
appropriate aids are automatically selected during the information update cycle.
foamed plastic. A synthetic resin filled with millions of tiny bubbles. Foamed
plastic is lightweight and resilient (soft and pliable) and is used as a packing
material and a thermal (heat) insulator. Foamed plastic is sometimes called
expanded plastic.
foaming (lubrication system malfunction). A condition in a lubrication system in
which oil passing through the engine picks up air which causes thousands of tiny
bubbles to form. Foaming oil does not lubricate efficiently, neither does it
adequately pick up heat. Foam is removed from the lubricating oil by passing the
oil through a deaerator system.
foam rubber. A form of rubber filled with millions of tiny air bubbles. These
bubbles were beaten into the latex before it was vulcanized.

FOD (foreign object damage). Damage to the components in the gas path of a
turbine engine that is caused by ingesting objects that are not part of the engine.
Technicians tools carelessly left in the intake ducts as well as debris from the
runways or taxiways can cause FOD when the engine is being run on the ground.
In flight, the ingestion of ice and birds can cause FOD.
foehn (meteorology). Warm, dry downslope wind whose warmness and dryness
is caused by adiabatic compression upon descent. Foehns are characteristic of
mountainous regions. See adiabatic process, Chinook, Santa Ana.
fog (meteorology). An obscuration to visibility caused by water droplets that are
small enough to remain suspended in the air. Fog differs from drizzle in that it
does not fall to the surface, and it differs from cloud only because it extends all
the way down to the surface.
foil. A form of metal rolled out into very thin sheets. Foil is normally thought of
as a sheet of metal with a thickness of less than 0.15 millimeter (0.006 inch).
folded fell seam (machine-sewed fabric seam). A type of machine-sewed seam
in which the edges of the fabric are folded back and a double row of stitches
used to form the seam. The stitches pass through three thicknesses of material.

follow-up question (in teaching/learning process). In the guided discussion
method of presenting instructional material, a follow-up question is used by an
instructor to get a classroom discussion back on track if it strays from a main

application. One foot-pound is equal to 1.355818 joules.
foot-poundal (measurement of work). The basic measure of work in the English
absolute system. One foot-poundal is the amount of work done when one
poundal of force causes a movement of one foot in the direction of its
application. One foot-poundal is equal to 0.0421 joule. The difference between a
foot-pound and a foot-poundal is that foot-pounds use a measure of weight, and
foot-poundals use a measure of mass.

between the pilots, operate as a single aircraft with regard to navigation and
position reporting.
form drag. Parasite drag that is caused by the form of the object passing through
the air.
former (aircraft structural member). An aircraft structural member used to give a
fuselage its shape. The truss structure of an aircraft fuselage provides the
necessary strength, but its cross section is usually square or triangular and does
not have the clean aerodynamic shape needed for streamlining.

Formers of wood or light metal are attached to the truss, and stringers
(lightweight strips of metal or wood) are placed over the formers to give the
fuselage its shape. All of this structure is covered with fabric or thin sheet metal.
A monocoque fuselage carries most of its stresses in its outside skin whose
shape is produced by formers to which the skin is attached. Formers that divide a
fuselage into compartments are called bulkheads.
form factor (electrical inductor characteristic). The ratio of the length of a coil of
wire to its diameter. Form factor is one of the characteristics that affect the
inductance of a coil.
forming block (sheet-metal forming tool). A block of hardwood around which
sheet metal parts are formed.
forward bias (semiconductor operating condition). A condition of operation of a
semiconductor device, such as a transistor or a diode, in which a positive voltage
is connected to the P-type material, and a negative voltage is connected to the Ntype material. When the device is forward-biased, the barrier voltage is
minimum, and the maximum amount of current can flow through it.

location on an aircraft allowed for its loaded center of gravity.
forward current (semiconductor characteristic). Current that flows across the
junction in a semiconductor device when it is forward-biased.

configuration or tandem-wing configuration airplane. The surface may be a
fixed, movable, or variable geometry surface, with or without control surfaces.”
fouled spark plug (malfunctioning ignition system component). A spark plug
that is unable to fire because of contamination in its firing-end cavity. Oil, soot,
silicon deposits, or lead deposits can build up in the firing end until they provide
a bridge that allows the voltage to leak off before it can build up high enough to
jump across the gap between the electrodes.
four-corner post configuration (air traffic control). An arrangement of air traffic
pathways in a terminal area that brings incoming flights over fixes at four
corners of the traffic area, while outbound flights depart between the fixes, thus
minimizing conflicts between arriving and departing traffic.
four-harness satin (composites). A weave for composite fabric that is more
pliable than plain weave and is easier to conform to curved surfaces common in
reinforced plastics. In this weave pattern each warp thread passes under one fill
thread and over three. See satin-weave fabric.
four-stroke cycle. A constant-volume cycle of energy transformation that has
separate strokes for intake, compression, power, and exhaust. See Otto cycle.
four-stroke-cycle reciprocating engine. A form of reciprocating engine which
has an intake and an exhaust valve in each cylinder. Four strokes of the piston
(two in and two out) are needed to change chemical energy in the fuel into
mechanical energy at the rotating crankshaft.
During the intake stroke, the piston moves inward, with the intake valve open
and the exhaust valve closed. A mixture of fuel and air is pulled into the cylinder
through the carburetor.

On the compression stroke, the piston moves outward with both valves closed.
This compresses the fuel-air mixture. Near the end of the compression stroke,
the spark plug fires and ignites the compressed fuel-air mixture.
The burning fuel heats and expands the air inside the cylinder, and the
expanding air forces the piston inward on the power stroke. Near the end of the
power stroke, the exhaust valve opens.
During the exhaust stroke, the piston moves outward with the exhaust valve
open. As the piston moves outward, it forces the burned gases from the cylinder,
and the cylinder is prepared for another cycle of operation.
Fowler flap (airplane secondary flight control). A type of wing flap which moves
out of the trailing edge of a wing on tracks. Fowler flaps increase both the wing
area and camber which increases the lift and drag produced by the wing. They
allow the wing to produce its lift at a slower airspeed so less runway is required
for takeoff and landing.

FPD (freezing point depressant). A chemical compound added to a liquid to
lower its freezing temperature. FPDs are used in the fluid sprayed on an aircraft
to deice it before flight.
FPM. Feet per minute.
fraction. A number written in the form N⁄D in which N is the numerator and D is
the denominator. For example, 5 ⁄16 is a fraction.
fractional distillation. The procedure used for separating the various components
from a physical mixture of liquids. Crude oil is a mixture of many different types
of hydrocarbon fuels which can be separated by carefully raising its temperature.
The first products to be released, those having the lowest boiling points, are
some of the gaseous fuels; then gasoline, kerosine, diesel fuel, heavy fuel oils,
lubricating oils, and finally, tar and asphalt.

fractus (meteorology). Clouds in the form of ragged, irregular shreds, appearing
as if they were torn. Fractus clouds of the cumulus family are called
fractocumulus, and those in the stratus family are called fractostratus.
francium. An extremely unstable, radioactive chemical element. Francium’s
symbol is Fr, and its atomic number is 87. The most stable of francium’s
isotopes is Fr 223, which has a half-life of 21 minutes.
frangible. Breakable, or easily broken.
free balloon. A lighter-than-air device that is free to rise in the air. A free balloon
is used in weather observations to find the height of the base of the lower layer
of clouds. A rubber balloon is filled with helium until it has a specified diameter,
and it is released into the air. The rate of rise of this balloon is known, and the
time between its release and its disappearance into the clouds is measured. This
time determines the height of the base of the clouds.
free electrons. Electrons that are not bound to any particular atom. They are free
to move about from one atom to another in a material. A semiconductor material
having a large number of free electrons is called an N-type material.
free fit (threaded fastener). A loose fit between moving parts, used when
accuracy of movement is not important. A nut that turns easily over the threads
of a screw or bolt is said to have a free fit.
free flight. A method of air traffic management designed to enhance the safety,
capacity, and efficiency of the NAS. Under this system, air traffic control is
expected to move gradually from a highly structured system based on elaborate
rules and procedures to a more flexible system that allows pilots, within limits,
to change their route, speed, and altitude, notifying the air traffic controller of
the new route.
free-running multivibrator (electronic oscillator). A form of oscillator that
produces a square-wave output. It uses two transistors arranged in a circuit in
such a way that when one transistor begins to conduct (when it turns on), it turns
the other transistor off. When the second transistor turns off, it feeds a signal to
the first transistor that turns it off. When the first transistor turns off, it turns the
second one on.
A free-running multivibrator has no stable condition, and because of this, it is
called an astable (no stable condition) oscillator.

free turbine (gas turbine engine component). A turbine or stage of turbines in a
gas turbine engine that is not used to drive the compressor in the gas-generator
section of the engine. A free turbine may be used to drive the reduction gears for
the propeller in a turboprop engine, or the transmission and a rotor of a
helicopter. Free turbines are also used in industrial turbine engines to drive
pumps or generators. Free turbines are sometimes referred to as free power
turbines.
free-wheeling unit (rotorcraft). A component part of the transmission or power
train of a helicopter that automatically disconnects the main rotor from the
engine when the engine stops or slows below the equivalent RPM of the rotor.
freeze calculated landing time (air traffic control). A dynamic parameter number
of minutes prior to the meter fix calculated time of arrival for each aircraft when
the TCLT is frozen and becomes an ACLT (i.e., the VTA is updated and
consequently the TCLT is modified as appropriate until FCLT minutes prior to
meter fix calculated time of arrival, at which time updating is suspended and an
ACLT and a frozen meter fix crossing time (MFT) is assigned).
freeze/frozen (air traffic control). An ATC description used in reference to (1)
aircraft arrivals that have been assigned an actual calculated landing time
(ACLT), and (2) the list displaying ACLTs of aircraft arrivals.
freeze horizon (air traffic control). The time or point at which an aircraft’s STA
becomes fixed and no longer fluctuates with each radar update. This setting
insures a constant time for each aircraft, necessary for the metering controller to
plan his/her delay technique. This setting can be either in distance from the
meter fix or a prescribed flying time to the meter fix.
freeze speed parameter (air traffic control). A speed adapted for each aircraft to
determine fast and slow aircraft. Fast aircraft freeze on parameter FCLT and
slow aircraft freeze on parameter MLDI.
freezing. The process in which a liquid is changed into a solid by the removal of
heat energy. When enough heat energy is removed from liquid water, it freezes,
or turns into solid water (ice).
freezing level (meteorology). The level in the atmosphere at which the
temperature is 0°C (32°F).

freezing point. The temperature at which a liquid changes into a solid. In
petroleum specifications, freezing point is the temperature at which solids, such
as wax crystals, separate from a hydrocarbon fuel as it is cooled.
freezing rain (meteorology). Rain that falls through air whose temperature is
lower than 0°C. It is supercooled but remains in its liquid form. It freezes upon
contact with objects on the ground or in the air.
French fell seam (machine-sewed fabric seam). A type of machine-sewed seam
in which the edges of the two pieces of fabric are folded together, and a double
row of stitches passes through four thicknesses of the material.

Freon. The registered trade name for a fluorinated hydrocarbon compound used
as a refrigerant and a fire extinguishing agent. There are a number of Freon
compounds identified with numbers. Each compound having different
characteristics. Freon-12 has been the most commonly used refrigerant in
aircraft air conditioning systems, but because of environmental considerations it
is being phased out and replaced by R-134a which is more environmentally
friendly.
frequency. The number of complete cycles of a recurring event that take place in
one unit of time.
frequency converter (electronic circuit). A circuit which changes the frequency
of alternating current. Alternating current with a frequency of 1,000 hertz, for
example, can be changed to 200 hertz by combining it with an AC signal having
a frequency of 1,200 hertz. When alternating currents having these two
frequencies are combined, or mixed, two more alternating currents are produced:
one having a frequency which is the sum of the two, 2,200 hertz, and the other a
frequency which is the difference between the two—in this case, 200 hertz, the
desired frequency.
frequency divider (electronic circuit). An electronic circuit whose output has a
frequency that is an exact divisor of the frequency at the input. If a signal of 100

kilohertz is placed on the input of a frequency divider that divides by two, the
frequency at the output will be 50 kilohertz.
frequency doubler (electronic circuit). An electronic circuit whose output is
resonant at the second harmonic of the input signal. The frequency of the second
harmonic of an alternating current is exactly two times the frequency of the input
AC. The output frequency of the frequency doubler is two times that of the
input.
frequency meter (electrical measuring instrument). An electrical instrument that
measures the frequency of an alternating current and shows this frequency
directly on its dial. One commonly used type of frequency meter is a vibrating
reed-type instrument. A series of metal reeds of different lengths is excited by
the AC, and the reed that vibrates with the greatest amplitude is resonant at the
frequency of the AC. The frequency at which each reed is resonant is marked
beside each reed.
frequency modulation (radio communications). One method of putting an audio
frequency signal on a radio frequency carrier. Rather than the AF signal
changing the amplitude of the carrier, as is done in amplitude modulation (AM),
the AF signal changes the frequency of the carrier by an amount determined by
the amplitude of the audio signal. The amplitude of the frequency-modulated
carrier is clipped so static caused by electrical interference causes a minimum of
distortion.

frequency multiplier (electronic circuit). An electronic circuit whose output has a
frequency that is a multiple of the frequency of the input signal. Frequency
doublers and triplers are commonly used frequency multipliers.
frequency synthesizer (electronic circuit). An electronic circuit used to produce
alternating current having an accurately controlled frequency. One type of

frequency synthesizer uses a crystal-controlled oscillator to produce a single
accurate frequency. Frequency multipliers and dividers change the crystal
frequency into the required frequencies.
fresh annual inspection. A term used frequently when selling aircraft. It means
that the aircraft has recently had an annual inspection.
freshening charge (battery servicing). A constant-voltage charge given to drycharged batteries to get them ready for installation. Most lead-acid batteries are
shipped from the manufacturer in a dry-charged state. The battery was charged
at the factory, the electrolyte was drained, and the cells were sealed.
When the battery is ready to be put into service, electrolyte having the proper
specific gravity is poured into the cells, and the battery is given a constantvoltage freshening charge. The battery is considered ready for service when the
specific gravity of the electrolyte does not change in three hours of charging.
fretting. A type of mechanical damage to the surface of an object. Fretting is
caused by one object rubbing against another and wearing part of it away.
fretting corrosion. A form of corrosion between two surfaces which have a slight
amount of relative motion between them. The protective oxide coating that
forms on aluminum or magnesium alloys is rubbed away by the movement of
the parts. New oxides must be continually formed to replace those that are worn
away and these oxides act as an abrasive to further damage the metal.
friction. Opposition to the relative movement between two objects.
friction brake. A mechanism used with a rotating wheel or shaft in which friction
is used to slow its rotation.
friction clutch. A device used to connect a motor to a mechanical load. A plate
or cone on the load is driven by a mating device on the motor. A lining made of
a material that causes a good deal of friction separates the two surfaces, and a
spring forces the surfaces and lining tightly together, allowing the motor to drive
the load. The spring force can be released to disconnect the motor from the load.
friction drag. The portion of parasitic drag on a body resulting from viscous
shearing stresses over its wetted surface.
friction error (instrument indications). The error caused by friction in an
instrument mechanism. The amount of friction error is found by reading the

instrument, vibrating it, and then reading it again. The difference between the
two indications is the amount of friction error.
friction horsepower (reciprocating engine specification). The amount of
horsepower used to turn the crankshaft, pistons, gears and accessories in a
reciprocating engine, and to compress the air in the cylinders. The brake
horsepower actually delivered to the output shaft of the engine is the total
horsepower developed by the engine, less the friction horsepower.
friction level classifications (for a runway surface). The levels of friction value
in three classifications, which are allowed for the runway pavement surface as
measured by FAA-qualified “continuous friction measurement equipment”
(CFME). The CFME friction values are a guideline for evaluating the surface
friction deterioration of runway pavements, as well as for identifying the
appropriate corrective actions required for safe aircraft operations. The three
classification levels are minimum, maintenance planning, and new
design/construction (per Advisory Circular 150/5320-12).
friction-lock Cherry rivet. A type of self-plugging blind rivet in which a stem
with a tapered end is pulled through the hollow rivet shank. The tapered end
swells the shank to pull the sheets of metal being joined tightly together.
Continued pulling breaks the stem and leaves it wedged tightly inside the shank.
Friction holds the stem in the rivet shank, but it can vibrate out. For this reason
friction-lock rivets cannot be used to replace solid rivets on a size-for-size basis.
See Cherry rivet.
friction loss. The loss of mechanical energy in a mechanism caused by friction
changing mechanical energy into heat.
friction measurement (runway condition). A measurement of the friction
characteristics of the runway pavement surface, using continuous self-watering
friction measurement equipment in accordance with the specifications,
procedures, and schedules contained in AC 150/5320-12, Measurement,
Construction, and Maintenance of Skid-Resistance Airport Pavement
Surfaces.
friction tape. A type of electrical insulating tape that was commonly used in the
past, but is being replaced by more effective types of tape. Friction tape is a
cloth tape impregnated with a black, sticky, tar-like material.
friction welding. A method of joining thermoplastic materials by rubbing the

mating surfaces together while applying a large amount of pressure. Heat caused
by the friction softens the material, and the pressure fuses the softened edges
together.
Frise aileron (airplane control). A type of aileron used for lateral control of an
airplane. The hinge line of a Frise aileron is set back from the leading edge so a
portion of its surface is ahead of the hinge line. When the aileron is raised, to
lower the wing on which it is mounted, the portion ahead of the hinge line
protrudes below the wing and causes parasite drag. This parasite drag
counteracts the induced drag produced on the opposite wing when its aileron is
lowered. Frise ailerons minimize adverse yaw.

front (meteorology). A surface, interface, or transition zone of discontinuity
between two adjacent air masses having different densities. More simply, a front
is the boundary between two different air masses.
frontal zone (meteorology). A front or zone with a marked increase-of-density
gradient. The term frontal zone is used because fronts are not truly a “surface” of
discontinuity, but, rather, a “zone” of rapid transition of meteorological
elements.
frontogenesis (meteorology). The initial formation of a front or frontal zone.
frontolysis (meteorology). The dissipation of a front or frontal zone.
front-surface mirror. A mirror with the reflective material on its front surface,
rather than on the back.
front-to-back ratio (semiconductor characteristic). A rough measurement of the
condition of a semiconductor diode. When the resistance of the diode is
measured with an ohmmeter, it should have a high resistance one way (the
junction is reverse-biased), but when the leads are reversed, the resistance should

be low (the junction is forward-biased). A high front-to-back ratio normally
indicates a good diode.
frost (meteorology). Ice crystal deposits formed by sublimation when the
temperature and dew point are below freezing.
frustrum. The portion of a cone or a cone-shaped solid from which the top has
been removed. The top and the bottom of the frustrum are parallel surfaces, with
the top surface smaller than the bottom.
FSDO (Flight Standards District Office). An FAA field office serving an
assigned geographical area, staffed with Flight Standards personnel who serve
the aviation industry and the general public on matters relating to the
certification and operation of air carrier and general aviation aircraft. FSDO
activities include general surveillance of operational safety, certification of
airmen and aircraft, accident prevention, investigation, enforcement, etc.
FSS. See flight service station.
FTD. See flight training device.

coal, wood, and natural gas are all forms of fuel.
fuel-air mixture ratio. The ratio of the number of pounds of fuel to the number of
pounds of air in the mixture burned, in an internal combustion engine.
fuel boost pump (aircraft fuel system component). An auxiliary fuel pump used
in an aircraft fuel system to provide fuel pressure for starting the engine, for use
as an emergency backup in case the fuel pump fails, and to transfer fuel from
one tank to another.
fuel cell (electrical device). A type of electrical cell that converts chemical
energy directly into electrical energy. The electrical energy is produced by a
chemical reaction between an electrolyte and a liquid or gaseous fuel.
fuel control unit (gas turbine engine). The fuel metering device for a gas turbine
engine that senses the variables of power lever position, pressure, speed, and
temperature in the engine. The fuel control unit then meters the correct amount
of fuel to be sent to the burners for the existing conditions.
fuel dumping. Airborne release of usable fuel, a procedure used by aircraft in
certain emergency situations in order to either lighten the aircraft’s weight or to

reduce risk of fire. Used before a return to the airport shortly after takeoff, or
before landing short of the aircraft’s intended destination (an emergency
landing). Also referred to as a fuel jettison. (Note: this term does not refer to the
dropping of fuel tanks.)
fuel dump system (aircraft fuel system). See fuel jettison system.
fuel evaporation ice (carburetor ice). A type of carburetor ice that forms in the
throat of a float-type carburetor when the discharged fuel evaporates and lowers
the temperature of the air passing through the carburetor. As the air is cooled,
water vapor condenses into liquid water and freezes. See carburetor ice.
fuel flow. The rate at which fuel flows in a fuel metering system. Fuel flow is
normally expressed in terms of pounds per hour.
fuel flowmeter (aircraft instrument). An instrument used to show the rate of fuel
flowing to an engine. Fuel flowmeters used with modern fuel-injected
reciprocating engines are actually pressure gages that measure the pressure drop
across the injector nozzles. A popular flowmeter for turbine engines uses a small
turbine in the fuel line to the fuel control unit that measures the rate of fuel flow.
It converts this flow rate into an electrical signal and sends it to an indicator in
the instrument panel.
fuel flow transmitter (powerplant instrument). A device in the fuel line between
the engine-driven fuel pump and the carburetor that measures the rate of flow of
the fuel. The flowmeter transmitter converts the flow rate into an electrical signal
and sends it to an indicator in the instrument panel.
fuel grade (aviation gasoline characteristic). A system of rating aviation gasoline
according to its antidetonation characteristics. This is based on the older system
of octane rating or performance number in which the higher the number, the
more resistant the fuel is to detonation.
fuel heater (turbojet airplane fuel system component). A form of fuel-air heat
exchanger in which heat is taken from the compressor bleed air and put into the
fuel before it flows through the fuel filter. At high altitude, the temperature is so
low that water entrained in the fuel precipitates out and freezes on the fuel filter.
The fuel heater warms the fuel enough to prevent the water freezing.
fuel injection manifold valve (reciprocating engine component). The valve used
in a reciprocating engine fuel injection system that takes fuel from the fuel

control unit and distributes it to the various injection nozzles. The manifold
valve provides a metering force for conditions of low fuel flow, and also
provides a positive fuel shutoff when the engine is shut down. By shutting off
the fuel at the manifold valve, the lines to the injector nozzles are kept full of
fuel.
fuel injection system (reciprocating engine). A form of fuel metering system for
a reciprocating engine that injects the fuel directly into the cylinder, rather than
mixing it with the air before it is taken in through the intake valve. There are two
types of fuel injection systems in use, the direct injection system and the
continuous-flow injection system.
The direct injection system, such as is used in a diesel engine, sprays the fuel
into the cylinder under high pressure. The fuel is atomized by the spray for better
combustion.
The continuous-flow fuel injection system used on many of the modern
horizontally opposed aircraft engines is not a true injection system. It meters the
fuel and delivers it under a low pressure to the outside of the intake valve. This
fuel, along with the necessary air for combustion, is pulled into the cylinder
when the intake valve opens.
fuel jettison system. The portion of an aircraft fuel system that allows fuel to be
dumped from the tanks to lower the landing weight so a safe landing can be
made. Some aircraft are certificated with a higher takeoff weight than is allowed
for landing. If an emergency requires such an airplane to return for a landing
before enough fuel is used from the tanks to lower the weight enough for
landing, fuel may be dumped.
Boost pumps in the fuel tanks move the fuel from the tank into a fuel manifold.
From the fuel manifold it flows away from the aircraft through dump chutes in
each wing tip. The dumped fuel evaporates and is diluted by the air, so it causes
no danger to people on the ground. Fuel jettison systems are designed and
constructed in such a way that they are free from fire hazards.
fuel load. The expendable part of the load of the aircraft. Fuel load includes only
the fuel that is usable in flight.
fuel management system or function. An advanced avionics system that assists
the pilot in managing fuel by considering fuel flow, airspeed, and winds to help
predict remaining fuel at each waypoint along the programmed route, total
endurance, and the viability of alternative routings or diversions. Stand-alone

systems may integrate the output data into the FMS/RNAV or provide a discreet
display, while the fuel management function is an integral portion of the
FMS/RNAV system. In either instance, the fuel data management goals are
similar.
fuel nozzle (gas turbine engine component). The nozzle in a gas turbine engine
combustor through which the fuel is discharged. The spray pattern from the fuel
nozzle is such that the flame is always centered in the burner so it will not
overheat it.
fuel-oil heat exchanger (gas turbine engine component). A heat exchanger used
on turbine engines to take heat from the engine oil and put it into the fuel. The
fuel flows through tubes that pass through the hot engine oil. Heat from the oil
enters the fuel and raises its temperature, and at the same time, the temperature
of the oil is lowered.
fuel pump (fuel system component). An engine-driven or electrical pump that
moves fuel from the fuel tank to the fuel metering system.
fuel range ring. A graphical depiction of the point at which an aircraft is
predicted to exhaust its fuel reserves or reach a point at which only reserve fuel
remains.
“Fuel remaining” (air traffic control). A phrase used by either pilots or
controllers that relates to the fuel remaining on board until actual fuel
exhaustion. When transmitting such information in response to either a
controller question or pilot initiated cautionary advisory to air traffic control,
pilots will state the approximate number of minutes the flight can continue with
the fuel remaining. All reserve fuel should be included in the time stated, as
should an allowance for established fuel gage system error.
fuel selector valve. The valve in an aircraft fuel system that allows the pilot to
select the fuel tank that feeds the engine or engines.
fuel shut-off valve (fuel system component). A valve that shuts off the fuel
supply to the engine.
fuel siphoning. Unintentional release of fuel from an aircraft, caused by
overflow, puncture, loose tank caps, etc.
fuel system (aircraft system). The system of components that includes tanks, fuel

instrument. There are many different types of gages. A pressure gage is used to
indicate the amount of pressure being applied to a fluid. A depth gage is used to
measure the distance between the edge of a hole or groove and its bottom. A

different locations in the electrolytic, or galvanic, series. See galvanic series.
Corrosion can take place any time two metals are covered with an electrolyte.
The amount of corrosion is determined by the difference in the location of the
two metals in the galvanic series. The more active metal (the metal highest in the
galvanic series) acts as the anode in the electrolytic process, and is eaten away.
The more noble metal is not affected.
galvanic couple. A pair of unlike metals that produce an electrical potential
when they are covered with an electrolyte. Copper and zinc form a commonly
used galvanic couple. When a piece of copper and a piece of zinc are covered
with the same electrolyte, a voltage is produced between them. The zinc, being
the less noble of the two metals, forms the anode. Electrons leave the zinc and
travel to the copper. The copper is the positive terminal of the galvanic couple,
and the zinc is the negative terminal.

of the steel is covered with a coating of zinc. The zinc may be applied by hot
dipping or by electroplating.
galvanometer. An instrument used to measure electrical current. A galvanometer
measures the amount of current flowing in a circuit by measuring the interaction
between two magnetic fields. One field is produced by a permanent magnet, and
its strength is fixed. The other field, an electromagnetic field, is produced by

turbines, or the tail pipe.
gasket. A seal between two stationary objects. A gasket is usually made of a soft

seal. A gasket is similar to a packing, except a packing is used when there is
relative motion between the parts being sealed.

gas tungsten arc welding. See GTAW.
gas turbine engine. An internal combustion engine in which energy is released
from the fuel in a constant-pressure cycle. Air is taken into the engine and
compressed by either an axial-flow or a centrifugal compressor. The compressed
air then passes into the combustion chambers where fuel is sprayed into a
continuously burning fire. The burning fuel heats and expands the air which then
flows through a turbine, where some of the energy is extracted to turn the
compressor. The energy remaining in the gases leaving the engine causes the
exhaust velocity to be greater than that of the air entering the engine, and this
acceleration produces thrust. Some gas turbine engines use additional stages of
turbines to extract energy from the hot gases to drive such devices as fans,
propellers, rotors, generators, or pumps. Gas turbine engines are far superior to
reciprocating engines, with regard to their weight-to-horsepower ratio.
gas welding. A method of joining metals by melting them and allowing the
molten metal from the two pieces to flow together. The heat used to melt the
metal is provided by burning a mixture of fuel gas and oxygen. The two most
generally used fuel gases are acetylene and hydrogen.

GCA facility. Pilots should specifically request a PAR approach when a
precision radar approach is desired or request an ASR, or surveillance, approach
when a nonprecision radar approach is desired.
gear. A special wheel with notched teeth on its periphery. Gears transmit power
from one shaft to another without slippage by meshing the teeth of the gear on
one shaft with the teeth of the gear on the other. Gears are used to reverse the
direction of shaft rotation and to gain mechanical advantage.
gear and pinion mechanism. A mechanical force amplifying system that uses two
gears of different sizes. The smaller gear, the pinion, meshes with and turns
faster than the larger gear. The ratio between the number of teeth on the pinion
and the number on the large gear determines the mechanical advantage of the
mechanism.
gear backlash. The amount of clearance between the teeth of two meshed gears.
It is very important that the correct amount of gear backlash be maintained when
meshing gears. If there is no backlash, the teeth cannot be properly lubricated,
and the gears will wear excessively. If there is too much backlash, the load is not
properly transmitted from one tooth to the other.
Gear backlash is measured by holding one gear still and measuring, with a dial
indicator, the amount the meshing gear can move back and forth. Service
manuals for equipment using gears specify the amount of gear backlash required.
gear-driven supercharger (aircraft reciprocating engine component). An air
compressor driven by gears from the crankshaft of a reciprocating engine. Power
is taken from the engine to drive the supercharger, but the increase in power
produced by compressing the intake air more than compensates for the loss.
Gear-driven superchargers are not as efficient as turbochargers, because the
power used to drive a turbocharger would otherwise be wasted.

gears, and it is carried around the housing as the gears rotate. On the discharge
side of the pump, the gear teeth mesh, and the fluid is forced out of the pump.

suggest corrective action, but compliance with the suggestion is not mandatory.
Alerts include items that have been reported to be significant, but which have not
been fully evaluated at the time the material went to press. See Malfunction and
Defect Report.
general gas law. A single law that combines the laws of Boyle and Charles to
explain the relationship between the volume, the absolute pressure, and absolute
temperature of a gas. The general gas law is expressed in a formula as:

V2 = final volume
T1 = initial absolute temperature

which the stresses are carried in a portion of the structure made up of strips of
metal or wood that cross to form a diamond-shaped lattice. Geodetic structure

uses an external-tooth drive gear that meshes with and drives an internal-tooth
gear that has one more space for a tooth than there are teeth on the drive gear.
Both gears turn inside a close-tolerance housing.

As the gears rotate, fluid flows between the teeth that are beginning to unmesh,
and the fluid is carried around the pump as this space continues to open up. On
the discharge side of the pump, the teeth begin to mesh, and as the space
between the teeth becomes smaller, fluid is forced out of the pump.

getter. A small piece of alkaline metal placed inside an electron tube (vacuum
tube) when it is manufactured. When the tube is completed and the air evacuated
from it, current is passed through the getter which raises its temperature enough
to melt it, causing it to react with any oxygen left inside the tube. The silvery

in an upright condition when its base is tilted. Gyroscopes used in certain aircraft
flight instruments are mounted in gimbals. Some in single gimbals, and others in

gimbal, and it senses rotation only about the vertical axis of the aircraft. The
gyro in an attitude gyro instrument is mounted in a double gimbal, and it senses
rotation about both the lateral and the longitudinal axes.

gimbal control unit (GCU) (UAS operations). The GCU’s function is similar to a

perhaps the most deceptive that a seaplane pilot will experience and frequently
the most dangerous for seaplane operation. It inhibits depth perception during
landing and adds significant drag during takeoff.
glaze (aircraft brake malfunction). A hard, glass-like coating that forms on the
brake disk surface. The friction caused by the glazed surface is not uniform, and
when the brakes are applied, they grab and release at such a high rate that they
chatter or squeal. The glazed surface must be removed from a disk for the
braking to be effective.

distance of two miles (10,560 feet), it has a glide ratio of slightly more than 10:1.
glide slope (electronic navigation system). A portion of an Instrument Landing
System (ILS). The glide slope is a radio beam extending upward at angle of
approximately 2 1 ⁄2° from the approach end of an instrument runway. The glide
slope provides the vertical path for the aircraft to follow when making an ILS
approach along the localizer path. The horizontal needle of the cross-pointer
indicator (the ILS indicator) shows the pilot the relative position of the aircraft
as it descends along the glide slope. The glide slope is sometimes called the
glide path.

track to the active waypoint set in the GPS receiver.
glow-discharge tube (electronic device). A glass electron tube containing a gas
under a low pressure. A high voltage across two electrodes in the tube ionizes
the gas, and when electrons flow through the ionized gas, it glows. The type of
gas determines the ionization voltage and the color of the glow. Since the
ionization voltage remains constant regardless of the amount of current, glowdischarge tubes can be used to produce a reference voltage in a voltage regulator
circuit.
glow-plug igniter (turbine engine ignition component). A low-voltage turbine
engine igniter used on some of the smaller engines. It consists of a coiled
resistance element, whose inner end is connected to an insulated pin to which the

lead from the DC ignition exciter is connected. The outer end of the coil is
grounded to the igniter body. Current flowing through the resistance element
heats it until it glows orange-yellow, and air flowing through the coil produces a
streak of flame that ignites the fuel-air mixture in the combustor.
GLS. See GPS landing system.
glue. A general term used for an adhesive material.
glue joint (wood aircraft construction). A joint or connection made between two
pieces of wood by an adhesive, or glue, rather than any type of mechanical
fastener. The wood is prepared by shaping it so the grains in the two pieces are
parallel, and the surfaces to be glued are perfectly smooth and clean. The glue is
spread evenly over either one or both surfaces, and the surfaces are pressed
together and held by clamps until the glue dries. A correctly made glue joint is
stronger than the wood itself.

certain types of electrical machinery.
GNSS. See global navigation satellite system.
go, no-go gage. A type of measuring device used to determine whether or not the
dimensions of an object being measured are within allowable limits. A go, no-go
gage can be used to determine if a hole is of the correct size. If the hole is at least
as large as the minimum diameter allowed, the “go” part of the gage will fit into
it, and if it is no larger than the maximum diameter allowed, the “no-go” part of
the gage will not fit into it.

carbon at a high temperature and in a controlled atmosphere. Graphite fibers are
very strong and stiff.
graupel (meteorology). Also called soft hail or snow pellets, these are white,
round or conical ice particles 1 ⁄8 to 1 ⁄4 inch diameter. They often form as a

thunderstorm matures and indicate the likelihood of lightning.
graveyard spiral (flight maneuver). An inadvertent flight maneuver that can
develop when flying without reference to a natural or instrument horizon. An
inherently stable airplane, if left to its own devices, will eventually develop into
a coordinated, constant-rate descending spiral. Because the maneuver is
coordinated, the pilot has no sensation of turning. The airspeed builds up and the
altitude decreases. The natural instinct is to come back on the stick or wheel.
This only exacerbates the situation. This is called a graveyard spiral because,
before the common use of turn coordinators or turn and slip indicators, many
pilots were killed in the ensuing crash.
gravitational acceleration. The acceleration (speeding up) of a freely falling
object caused by the attraction of the mass of the earth. If an object is allowed to
fall freely in a vacuum, it will accelerate at a rate of 32.2 feet per second, or
980.7 centimeters per second, each second it falls.
gravity. The force of attraction between objects. The force of gravity is directly
proportional to the mass of the objects (the greater the mass, the stronger the pull
of gravity), and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the
objects (the farther apart the objects, the weaker the pull of gravity).

changes in each successive binary word. The Gray code is used for optical
encoders that translate degrees of shaft movement into a binary signal.

produced by the oscillator when the meter dips is the resonant frequency of the
circuit.

sharp metal cannot damage them.
gross navigation error (GNE). In the North Atlantic area of operations, a gross
navigation error is a lateral separation of more than 25 NM from the centerline
of an aircraft’s cleared route, which generates an Oceanic Navigation Error
Report. This report is also generated by a vertical separation if you are more than
300 feet off your assigned flight level.
gross thrust (turbine engine specification). The thrust produced by a turbojet or
turbofan engine when the engine is static, or not moving. The air is considered to
have no inlet velocity, and the velocity of the gas leaving the engine is
considered to be the acceleration factor. Gross thrust includes the thrust
generated by the momentum of the outgoing gases and the thrust resulting from
the difference between static pressure at the nozzle and ambient pressure.

can be adjusted when the engine is not running. The adjustment requires
loosening the blades in the hub.
ground adjustable trim tab (secondary flight control). A small, fixed, metal tab
that is attached to the trailing edge of a rudder, elevator, or aileron. It may be
bent to deflect the air leaving the surface to produce an aerodynamic force that
moves the surface on which it is attached to trim the aircraft for straight and
level flight at a desired airspeed.

encountered prior to departure, usually associated with a controlled departure
time (CDT) program.
ground delay program (GDP). A traffic management process administered by the
ATCSCC; when aircraft are held on the ground. The purpose of the program is
to support the TM mission and limit airborne holding. It is a flexible program
and may be implemented in various forms depending upon the needs of the AT
system. Ground delay programs provide for equitable assignment of delays to all
system users.

grounded-collector amplifier (transistor amplifier). See common-collector
amplifier.
grounded-emitter amplifier (transistor amplifier). See common-emitter amplifier.
ground effect (aerodynamics). An increase in lift of an aerodynamic flying
machine (airplane or helicopter) flying very near the ground. This additional lift
is caused by an effective increase in angle of attack without the accompanying
increase in induced drag and is caused by the deflection of the downwashed air.

Ground effect disappears when the flying machine is about a half wing span or
half rotor span above the surface.
ground fog (meteorology). A fog that conceals less than six tenths of the sky and
is not a part of the cloud base.

normally used for operating a gas turbine engine on the ground so it produces the
minimum amount of thrust. Ground idle is normally in the range of 60% to 70%
of the maximum RPM.
ground loop (aircraft operation). A sharp, uncontrolled change in direction of an
airplane on the ground. Tail wheel-type airplanes are highly subject to ground
looping because their center of gravity is behind the point at which the main
wheels contact the ground.
ground loop (electrical condition). A condition of unwanted current flow in a
circuit that uses shielded wire (wire encased in a braided metal cover). The
purpose of the shielding is to intercept and carry to ground electrical energy
radiated from the wires inside the shielding.
If the shielding is connected to the ground at more than one point, it is possible
for current to flow out one connection, through the ground, and back into the
shielding through another connection. This current flowing in the shielding can
interfere with delicate electrical signals in the shielded wire. To prevent ground
loops, the shielding is grounded at one point only.
ground plane (radio antenna component). A reflector used with a vertically
polarized, quarter-wavelength radio antenna. Horizontal arms or a flat metal
plane that sticks out at least a quarter wavelength from the base of the antenna
reflects the signal.

ground weather surveillance radar system. Any ground-based facility equipped
to gather information about significant weather across a wide area.
ground reference maneuvers (flight training maneuver). Ground reference
maneuvers and their related factors are used in developing a high degree of pilot
skill. Although most of these maneuvers are not performed as such in normal
everyday flying, the elements and principles involved in each are applicable to
performance of the customary pilot operations. They aid the pilot in analyzing
the effect of wind and other forces acting on the airplane and in developing a
fine control touch, coordination, and the division of attention necessary for
accurate and safe maneuvering of the airplane.
ground resonance (helicopter operation). Destructive vibration that occurs with a
helicopter, usually on landing. If the helicopter touches down rough and
unevenly, the shock can throw a load into the lead-lag hinges of the rotor blades
and cause the blades to oscillate (move back and forth) about this hinge.
If the frequency of this oscillation is the same as the resonant frequency of the
fuselage, the energy will cause the helicopter to strike the ground hard with the
opposite skid or wheel. This will increase the energy and cause more severe
contact with the ground. If corrective action is not taken immediately, either
lifting the helicopter or placing it firmly on the ground, ground resonance can
destroy it.
ground-return circuit (electrical circuit). An electrical circuit using the ground or
the structure of a vehicle as one of its conductors. Almost all automobiles and
aircraft use ground-return electrical systems. One of the terminals of the battery,
usually the negative terminal, is connected directly to the framework of the
vehicle.
One wire is used to connect the components to the positive terminal of the
battery, and another wire connects the component to the structure. The return
current from the component flows back to the battery through the structure.
ground speed (aircraft navigation). The speed at which an aircraft is moving over
the ground. When an aircraft is flying, its speed through the air is its airspeed.
The air moves over the ground and carries the aircraft with it, so the ground
speed is the vector sum of the airspeed and the direction of flight of the aircraft,
combined with the speed and direction of the air movement over the ground (the
wind speed and direction).
If the air is moving in the same direction the aircraft is flying, the ground speed

is equal to the airspeed plus the speed of the air movement. If the wind is
blowing in the direction opposite that which the aircraft is flying, the ground
speed is equal to the airspeed minus the speed of the wind. When the wind is
blowing at an angle to the flight path, the ground speed is found by adding the
airspeed and the wind speed as vectors.
ground stop (GS) (air traffic control). The GS is a process that requires aircraft
that meet a specific criteria to remain on the ground. The criteria may be airport
specific, airspace specific, or equipment specific; for example, all departures to
San Francisco, or all departures entering Yorktown sector, or all Category I and
II aircraft going to Charlotte. GS’s normally occur with little or no warning.
ground support equipment (aircraft operations). All the equipment needed to
service and maintain aircraft on the ground. Ground support equipment includes
such equipment as tugs to move the aircraft and auxiliary power units to provide
electrical power and compressed air when the engines are not running.

electromagnetic wave that travels from the transmitting antenna along the
surface of the earth.
growler. A piece of electrical test equipment used to check armatures in DC
motors and generators for open or shorted turns in the windings. The armature to
be tested is placed on the growler, and the AC power is turned on. The growler
acts as the primary of a transformer and the armature as the secondary. A
voltmeter is used to measure the voltage induced into the armature windings. A
growler gets its name from the growling noise made when an armature is being
tested.
GS. See glide slope.
GTAW (gas tungsten arc welding). A method of electric arc welding in which
the electrode in the torch is a fine, nonconsumable tungsten wire. The arc is
enveloped in a flow of an inert gas such as argon or helium. GTAW was

thunderstorm from warm, humid surface air. Air tends to be cool and gusty
behind the gust front.
gust lock (aircraft control systems). A ground lock for aircraft controls, used to
prevent the wind damaging the control surfaces by knocking them against their
stops. Gust locks may either be built-in features of the control system or external
locks that are slipped between the movable surface and the fixed structure. All
gust locks are required to have some kind of warning device to indicate to the
pilot that they are installed or engaged.
gustnadoes (meteorology). Cold air being forced out from under an advancing
storm swirls at the storm’s head (gust front). The result is a gustnado that lasts
for a relatively short period of time. These phenomenon appear as a dust whirl or
debris cloud that look very similar to a horizontal tornado.

high and low Mach speed buffets.
“GWPS”. See ground proximity warning system (GPWS)
gyro. See gyroscope.

reference for a direction-seeking pickup. The direction-seeking pickup of a
gyrocompass lines up with the magnetic field of the earth just as an ordinary
magnetic compass, but the gyroscope keeps it from oscillating.

gyrocopter. A trademark applied to gyroplanes designed and produced by the
Bensen Aircraft Company.
gyrodyne. 14 CFR Part 1: “A rotorcraft whose rotors are normally engine
driven for takeoff, hovering, and landing, and for forward flight through part of
its speed range, and whose means of propulsion, consisting usually of
conventional propellers, is independent of the rotor system.”
gyro horizon (aircraft flight instrument). A gyroscopic flight instrument that
gives the pilot an artificial reference for the pitch and roll attitude of the aircraft.
A gyroscope with an erection system that keeps it perpendicular to the earth’s
surface controls a bar that remains parallel with the horizon. By referring to this
instrument, the pilot can keep the aircraft level when the natural horizon is not
visible.
gyroplane (type of aircraft). A type of rotorcraft whose main rotors are not
connected to the engine except for the initial spin-up. Aerodynamic forces cause
the main rotor to spin during normal flight. An autogiro is a form of gyroplane.
14 CFR Part 1: “A rotorcraft whose rotors are not engine driven, except for
initial starting, but are made to rotate by action of the air when the rotorcraft is
moving; and whose means of propulsion, consisting usually of conventional
propellers, is independent of the rotor system.”
gyroscope. A rapidly spinning wheel with its weight concentrated about its rim.
Gyroscopes have two basic characteristics that make them useful: rigidity in
space and precession. Because of its rigidity in space, the spinning gyroscope
does not tilt its axis of rotation as the earth rotates.
Precession is the characteristic that causes the gyroscope to react to an applied
force at a point 90° away from the point of application, in the direction of its
rotation. Gyroscopes are used in both attitude and rate indicating flight
instruments. See rigidity in space and gyroscopic precession.
gyroscopic precession. A characteristic of a gyroscope that causes it to react to
an applied force as though the force were applied at a point 90° in the direction
of rotation, from the actual point of application.
Precession is the characteristic used in rate gyros. A rate gyro will precess, or
lay over in its gimbal, an amount proportional to the rate at which the gimbal is
rotated. Rate gyros are the heart of turn and slip indicators and turn coordinators.
The rotor of a helicopter acts in much the same way as a gyroscope and is
affected by gyroscopic precession.

gyroscopic turn indicator. A rate-type flight instrument used to show the pilot
the rate at which the aircraft is rotating about its vertical axis. Both turn and slip
indicators and turn coordinators are gyroscopic turn indicators.

hafnium. A brilliant, silvery, metallic chemical element. Hafnium’s symbol is
Hf, its atomic number is 72, and its atomic weight is 178.49. Hafnium has an
extremely high melting point (above 2,000°C) and is used in the manufacture of
filaments for incandescent lamps.
hail (meteorology). A form of precipitation which comes from cumulo nimbus
clouds. Hail forms when drops of water are carried by up-currents of air inside
the cloud to a level where the temperature is low enough that the water freezes
into pellets of ice.
Near the top of the cloud, the ice pellets are thrown from the up-current and fall
into the warmer air below. They pick up more water and are again carried
upward. Each trip up and down allows the ice pellets, called a hailstones, to gain
another layer of ice. This process continues until the hail is too heavy to stay in
the cloud. Some hailstones grow large enough to cause severe damage to people,
property, or animals on the ground.
hair hygrometer. An instrument used to measure the humidity of the air. The
sensitive element in a hair hygrometer is a bundle of human hair held under a
slight tension by a spring. The length of the hair expands or contracts as the
humidity in the air changes. This change in length moves a pointer over a
calibrated scale.

hairline crack. A tiny crack visible on the surface of a piece of material.
hairspring. A flat, spirally wound spring used to provide a restraint for rotary
motion of a shaft. Hairsprings are used in D’Arsonval-type electrical instruments
to provide a calibrated restraint for the moving coil and to carry current into and
out of the coil. Hairsprings are also used in spring-powered clocks and watches
to regulate the movement of the balance wheel.
HAL (height above landing) (air traffic control). The height above a designated
helicopter landing area used for helicopter instrument approach procedures.

half hitch. A type of knot used for lacing wire bundles together. The bundle is
tied with two half hitches secured with a square knot.
half-life. A measure of the rate of decay of radioactive material. In one half-life,
the material decays, or loses one half of its radioactivity. In the next half-life
interval, the material loses one half of that which is left. The half-life of various

alternating current into pulsating direct current. One rectifier, either a
semiconductor diode or a diode electron tube, is used to block the flow of one
half of the AC wave while allowing the other half to pass through. Half-wave
rectifiers are inefficient and do not produce smooth direct current. However,
they are used where economy of components is important and pulsations in the
output are of no concern.

Hall-effect generator (electronic device). An electronic device which uses a thin
wafer of semiconductor material to measure the intensity of a magnetic field.
Control current flowing through the generator produces a Hall-effect voltage
whose direction is perpendicular to the current, and whose intensity is

their head for shaping sheet metal.
hammer welding. A form of forge welding in which the edges of two pieces of
metal are heated red-hot and then pounded together with a hammer.
handbook. A manual that describes an operation or a system of operations. A
handbook normally contains specific rather than general information, and is
usually prepared in a format that allows it to be kept at the point it is to be used.
For example, a handbook on the operation of a piece of machinery should be
kept with the machinery, rather than in a library or office.
hand-cranked inertia starter (reciprocating engine starter). A starter for a large
aircraft reciprocating engine that uses a hand crank to store energy in a spinning
flywheel. The crank drives the flywheel through a high-ratio gear system to spin
it at a high speed and store a great deal of kinetic energy. When the flywheel is
spinning, the hand crank is removed and the flywheel is coupled, through a slip
clutch, to the engine crankshaft. There is enough energy in the spinning flywheel
to turn the engine fast enough for it to start. Many electric-inertia starters have
provisions for spinning the flywheel with a hand crank when there is no
electrical power available for starting.

tubing without it collapsing. The tubing is bent around a deep-grooved radius
block, using a sliding bar with a matching groove.
hand propping. Starting an aircraft engine by rotating the propeller by hand.
hand pump (hydraulic system component). A device used in a hydraulic system

to move fluid. Most hand pumps are of the piston type, in which movement of
the pump lever, or handle, moves a piston inside the pump. Some hand pumps
are single-acting, which means that they move fluid only during one stroke of
the handle. No fluid is moved during the return stroke. Other hand pumps are
double-acting, which means that they move fluid during both strokes of the
handle. Most aircraft hydraulic systems that use an engine-driven or electric
motor-driven hydraulic pump have a hand pump as a backup in case the power
pump fails.

treatment or cold-working.
hardened steel. Steel that has been heated red-hot and then quenched in brine,
water, or oil. Hardened steel is strong but brittle.
hardener (plastic resin component). A material used with a plastic resin to
improve its hardening.
hardening (metal heat treatment). A step in the heat treatment of metal in which
the metal is made hard but brittle. Most ferrous metals (metals containing iron)
are hardened by heating them to a specified temperature and then quenching
them in oil, water, or brine. Other metals can be hardened only by cold-working
them: by rolling them between steel rollers or by bending or hammering them.
hard-facing. A method of increasing the hardness of the face of a steel tool to
keep it from being worn away in normal use. Hard-facing is done by welding,
plating, or spraying a hard material, such as a carbide, on the surface of the tool.
hard landing (aircraft operation). An airplane landing in which enough forces
have been transmitted into the structure to have likely caused damage.
hardness. The ability of a material to resist being scratched. Hardness is
measured using the Mohs scale, which rates the hardness of a material by
comparing it with ten minerals that have been given Mohs hardness values from
one to ten. These minerals range from talc, whose Mohs hardness is one, through
gypsum, calcite, fluorite, apatite, orthoclase, quartz, topaz, corundum, to
diamond. Diamond has a Mohs hardness of ten.
hardness test. A test that can be made of either metallic or nonmetallic materials
to determine their physical condition. A cone- or a ball-shaped tool is forced into
the surface of the material, and the diameter or depth of the penetration caused
by a given amount of force is measured. The diameter or depth of the penetration
is related to the hardness and the strength of the material. See Rockwell hardness
tester and Brinell hardness test.
hard rubber. Rubber that has been vulcanized under high temperature and
pressure to make it hard. Hard rubber is used as an electrical insulator and for the
handles of many different types of tools.

The first harmonic of a 400-Hz vibration has a frequency of 400 Hz. The
frequency of the first harmonic is the same as the fundamental frequency. The
second harmonic has a frequency of 800 hertz, and the third harmonic has a
frequency of 1,200 hertz.
harness (electrical). A bundle of wires routed through an aircraft structure,
connecting electrical components to each other and to the power bus.
Hartley oscillator. A popular electronic oscillator circuit which uses a tapped coil
in parallel with a capacitor to determine the frequency of the AC the circuit
produces. Energy from the collector of a transistor, or the plate of a vacuum
tube, passes through one half of the coil and induces a voltage in the other half.
This induced voltage is applied to the base of the transistor, or the grid of the
vacuum tube, with a polarity that causes the circuit to oscillate, or produce
alternating current.

space level with the pilot’s head and eyes, and between the pilot and the forward
windscreen. The HUD displays a combination of control, performance,
navigation and command information superimposed on the external field of
view. It includes the display element, sensors, computers and power supplies,
indications and controls. It is integrated with airborne attitude, air data and
navigation systems, and as a display of command information is considered a
component of the flight guidance system.
head-up guidance system (HGS). A system which projects critical flight data on
a display positioned between the pilot and the windscreen. In addition to
showing primary flight information, the HUD computes an extremely accurate

instrument approach and landing guidance solution, and displays the result as a
guidance cue for head-up viewing by the pilot. See HUD.
head wind (aircraft flight). A wind which blows from the direction the aircraft is
flying. The ground speed of an aircraft (the speed the aircraft is moving over the
ground) is less than the speed through the air by the velocity of the head wind.

thought process when making decisions.
hearth furnace. A type of furnace used to melt iron and steel. The metal is melted
by passing hot gases over the charge of metal on the floor, or hearth, of the
furnace.
heat. A form of energy that affects the speed of movement of the molecules of
which a material is made. The more heat energy in a material, the faster its
molecules move, and the amount of heat energy in a material determines its
physical condition. Water that contains very little heat energy is a solid, ice.
When heat is added to ice, the ice melts and becomes liquid water. Additional
heat added to the liquid water causes it to boil, and it becomes water vapor
(steam).
Our chief source of heat energy is the sun. Heat energy from the sun reaches
the earth by radiation, and it is stored in plants and animals in the form of
chemical energy. This chemical energy can be changed back into heat energy by
the use of various types of machines.
heat engine. A form of mechanical device that converts heat energy into
mechanical energy. The two most widely used types of heat engines for aircraft
are reciprocating engines and turbine engines.
heater (electron tube). A small strip of resistance wire mounted inside a tubular
cathode in an electron tube. Low-voltage AC flowing through the heater causes
it to get red-hot. This heats the cathode enough for it to emit, or give off,
electrons.
heat dissipation. The loss of heat.
heat exchanger. A device used to exchange heat from one medium to another.
Radiators, condensers, and evaporators are all examples of heat exchangers.
Heat always moves from the object or medium having the greatest level of heat
energy to a medium or object having a lower level. Air-to-air, air-to-liquid,

liquid-to-air, and liquid-to-liquid heat exchangers are commonly used with
aircraft engines.

across a source of electrical energy. The resistance of the element is high enough
that current flowing through it produces enough heat to cause it to glow red-hot.
heat lamp. A form of incandescent lamp that produces a maximum of infrared
radiation (heat) with a minimum of visible light rays. Heat lamps are used for
curing resins, drying paint, keeping food warm, and applying heat to parts of the
human body.
heat load (air conditioning system). The amount of heat that must be added to or
taken away from the inside of an aircraft cabin, during a specified unit of time,
to keep the temperature of the cabin constant.
heat of compression (physics). Heat that is introduced into a gas by its
compression.
heat pump. A device that moves heat from one location to another. An air
conditioning system is a form of heat pump. Heat from inside the aircraft cabin
is absorbed by a liquid refrigerant. When the refrigerant absorbs the heat, it
evaporates, or changes into a gas. The gas is then compressed, and the
compression raises its temperature higher than that of the outside air.
The compressor forces the hot gas through the condenser, located outside the
aircraft. Here, the gas transfers some of its heat to the outside air and condenses
back into a liquid. Heat in this way is pumped from inside the aircraft cabin to
the air outside the aircraft.
heat-shrinkable fabric. Certain inorganic fabrics used to cover aircraft structure.
The fabric used for this purpose is sold in its unshrunk state and is put on the
structure so that it is taut, but not tight. After it is secured to the structure with a
special adhesive, it is shrunk to the correct tautness by ironing it with an electric
iron or blowing it with a special heater/blower.
After the fabric has the correct tautness, it is coated with a nontautening dope.
Organic fabrics, such as cotton and linen, are not heat-shrinkable and are shrunk
on the structure with a shrinking-type dope.
heat sink. A piece of heavy metal on which such electrical components as power
transistors are mounted. Heat from the component is transferred into the heat
sink by conduction, and from there it is dissipated into the surrounding air. A

silicone grease may be spread between the component and the heat sink to help
transfer the heat. Many heat sinks on which high-power components are
mounted have fins to increase their cooling area.
heat treatment (metal). A process by which certain types of metal are hardened
or softened by heat. Most metals containing iron can be hardened by heating
them to a high temperature and quenching them in water, brine (a solution of salt
and water), or oil. These same metals can be softened by heating them to a high
temperature and allowing them to cool slowly in an oven. Copper cannot be
hardened with heat. When copper is heated red-hot and quenched in water, it
becomes soft. Metals that cannot be hardened with heat can be work hardened by
bending, hammering, rolling, or stretching. However, most of these metals can
be softened by heating them and cooling them slowly.
heat treatment (plastic resins). A process used to strengthen cemented joints in
thermoplastic resins. After the cemented joint is completed, the material is held
at an elevated temperature (not high enough to distort the material) for a
specified period of time. The heat causes solvents concentrated in the joint to
diffuse (to spread evenly) throughout the material. This diffusion decreases the
concentration of the solvents in the joint and increases its strength.
Heaviside layer (atmosphere). A layer of ionized particles that surrounds the
earth at a height of about 55 to 85 miles above the surface. The Heaviside layer
is also called the Kennelly Heaviside layer and the E-region of the atmosphere.
The Heaviside layer reflects relatively long, low-frequency radio waves.
heavy ends (petroleum refining). The components of crude petroleum that have
the highest boiling points. In the process of fractional distillation, the lighter
products boil off first and are condensed. The heavy ends are the parts of the
petroleum that boil off last.
heavy hydrogen. Isotopes of hydrogen having one or two neutrons in the
nucleus. Isotopes with one neutron are called deuterium 2H, and isotopes with
two neutrons are called tritium 3H.
heavy water. A compound of hydrogen and oxygen containing a larger
proportion of deuterium (an isotope of hydrogen with one neutron in the
nucleus) than normally occurs in water.
hecto. The metric prefix that means one hundred (1 x 102). Hecto is used as a
prefix, as in hectometers (100 meters), hectoliters (100 liters), etc.

hedge-hop (aircraft flight). To fly an aircraft very near the surface of the earth.
This flight is below the level of many obstructions on the ground, and the
aircraft must be pulled up to pass over these obstructions. Hedge-hopping is both
dangerous and illegal in all except a few special instances, such as agricultural
application.
heel of a bend (rigid fluid lines). The outside of a bend. The metal in the heel of
a bend in rigid tubing has been stretched and is thinner than in other parts of the
tubing.

the length between two successive crests (swell length).
height-velocity envelope (helicopter operation). A chart produced by the
manufacturer of a helicopter showing the conditions of airspeed related to height
that produces conditions unsafe for an autorotative landing.
Heliarc welding. A name used for inert-gas arc welding. There are two basic
types of Heliarc welding: TIG (tungsten inert-gas) welding and MIG (metal
inert-gas) welding. TIG welding uses a small-diameter nonconsumable tungsten
rod as the electrode from which the arc jumps to the metal being welded. MIG
welding uses a consumable soft steel rod as an electrode. This rod melts and
adds metal to the molten pool to reinforce the weld.
helical potentiometer (electrical component). A multi-turn potentiometer, or
variable resistor. The resistance element is made in the form of a spiral, or helix,
and the wiper is moved over the element by turning a multi-turn screw. Most
helical potentiometers require ten turns of the screw to move the wiper from one
end of the resistance element to the other.
helical spline. A spline that twists, or winds, around the periphery of a shaft.
Helical splines are used to change linear motion of the device that rides on the

splines into rotary motion of the shaft on which the splines are cut. They are also
used to change rotary motion of the shaft into linear motion of the device that
rides on it.
Helical splines are cut onto the shaft of some aircraft engine starter motors to
move the starter gear into mesh with the flywheel gear (linear motion) when the
starter shaft is spun (rotary motion).
helical spring. A coil spring wound in the form of a spiral, or helix. Helical
springs can be wound in such a way that they can absorb either tensile or
compressive loads.

Heli-Coil insert. The registered trade name for a special helical insert used to
restore threads that have been stripped from a hole. The damaged threads are
drilled out, and new threads are cut with a special oversize tap. A stainless steel
coil of wire whose cross section is in the shape of a diamond is screwed into the
hole and left there to serve as the new threads.
Heli-Coil inserts are also used to provide durable threads in soft metal castings.
Some spark plug holes in cast-aluminum cylinder heads are fitted with Heli-Coil
inserts to minimize the wear caused by repeated removal and installation of the
spark plugs.
helicopter. A heavier-than-air flying machine that is supported in the air by
aerodynamic lift produced by an engine-driven rotor. Since the rotor is engine
driven, a helicopter does not need forward motion through the air for the rotor to
produce lift.

heliport reference point (HRP). The geographic center of a heliport.
helium. A colorless, odorless, tasteless, inert gaseous chemical element.
Helium’s symbol is He, its atomic number is 2, and its atomic weight is 4.0026.
Because helium will not combine with other chemical elements, it is used to
force oxygen away from the molten metal in certain types of arc welding, and to
fill some types of electron tubes to prevent oxygen from contacting the hot
filaments. Because of its lightness and because it will not burn, helium is used to
inflate lighter-than-air aircraft.
helix. A screw-like, or spiral, curve.
henry. The basic unit of inductance. One henry, H, is the amount of inductance
needed to produce an electromotive force of one volt, when the current in the
inductor changes at the rate of one ampere per second.

which has a very low critical pressure and temperature, is used as the low
reference fuel (octane zero) in determining the octane rating of a reciprocating
engine fuel.

used on dividers, and one leg of an outside caliper. Hermaphrodite calipers are
used to scribe a mark along a piece of material a specific distance from the edge.

hermetic seal. An airtight seal used to protect components or devices from the
effect of moisture in the air. To achieve a hermetic seal, air is pumped out of the
container or displaced by a dry inert gas, such as nitrogen, and the container is
sealed so no moisture can get into it.
herringbone gear. A gear whose teeth are cut across its face in the shape of a V.
A herringbone gear is similar to two helical gears whose teeth run in opposite
directions, mounted side-by-side on the shaft.
hertz. The term used for the frequency of any cyclic repetition. One hertz, Hz, is
one cycle of events each second.
Hertz antenna (radio antenna). An ungrounded, half-wave antenna whose
resonant frequency is determined by its distributed capacity. This capacity, and
therefore its resonant frequency, is determined by the antenna length.
heterodyne. To mix two electrical or acoustic signals having different
frequencies so they produce two new signals whose frequencies are different
from either of the two original signals. If a signal with a frequency of 1,000 hertz
is mixed with a signal having a frequency of 800 hertz, two new frequencies are
produced: the sum of the two frequencies, 1,800 hertz, and the difference
between the two, 200 hertz.
heterodyne-type frequency meter. An instrument used to determine the
frequency of alternating current. The frequency of an accurately calibrated
internal oscillator is varied and compared with the frequency being measured.

When the two frequencies are mixed, a third frequency, called the beat
frequency, is produced. This beat frequency is the difference between the two.
The variable frequency is changed until the beat frequency disappears. When it
disappears, the frequency being measured is the same as that being produced by
the oscillator.
heterogeneous mixture. A physical mixture of dissimilar ingredients. Concrete is
a heterogeneous mixture of sand, gravel, and portland cement.
hexadecimal number system. A number system that uses 16 as its base. The
values from 0 through 9 are represented by the numerals 0 through 9, and values
from 10 through 15 use the letters A through F. Hexadecimal numbers can easily
be converted into binary numbers for use in a computer. Values of up to decimal
255 or binary 1111 1111 can be expressed by using only two hexadecimal digits,
FF.

hexagon. A closed, plane figure that has six sides.

hexagon head bolt. A bolt whose head has six sides (a hexagon). A hex-head bolt
can be turned with an open-end wrench or with either a six-point or a 12-point
socket wrench. The six flat sides of a hex-head bolt allow the wrench to be
repositioned more often than could be done with a square-head bolt, and this
makes for easier installation and removal.
hexode (electron tube). A form of electron tube having six active electrodes. The
electrodes are the cathode, the anode, the control grid, and three other grids that
serve special functions in controlling the passage of electrons between the
cathode and the anode.

little current for full-scale deflection. Most high-impedance voltmeters have a
sensitivity of at least 20,000 ohms per volt, and when a very-high-impedance
voltmeter is needed, vacuum-tube or FET voltmeters are used. The sensitivity of
these meters is measured in megohms per volt. High-impedance voltmeters do
not load the circuit, which would give erroneous reading when voltage is
measured across a high resistance.

FORTRAN, COBOL, and PASCAL are examples of high-level languages.
high-lift device (aircraft component). Any component used to increase the lift
produced by an aircraft wing. High-lift devices include leading edge flaps, slots,
slats, trailing edge flaps, and boundary layer control systems. High-lift devices
allow the wing to reach a higher angle of attack and thus produce more lift,
before the airflow over its surface separates and the wing stalls.
high metal ion concentration cell corrosion. Corrosion that results from a

concentration of metallic ions in the electrolyte. The area of high concentration
of metallic ions is the cathode of the cell.
high-pass filter (electronic circuit). A type of electronic filter that passes, with

the insulation around certain shielded wires in an ignition system can withstand
the high voltage they carry without leaking an excessive amount of current to
ground. A high potential (high voltage) is placed between the center conductor
and the metal shield around the outside of the insulation. An indicator light
glows if the leakage current between the two conductors is excessive. A highpotential test is often called a high-pot test.
high-pressure compressor (gas turbine engine component). The second-stage
compressor in a dual-spool gas turbine engine. The high-pressure compressor,

and provided with lighting or marking to define the path of aircraft traveling at
high speed (up to 60 knots) from the runway center to a point on the center of a
taxiway. A high-speed taxiway is also referred to as a long-radius exit or turn-off
taxiway and is designed to expedite aircraft turning off the runway after landing,
thus reducing runway occupancy time.

treatment to between 50,000 and 100,000 pounds per square inch.
high-tension magneto (reciprocating engine ignition system). A self-contained
ignition system used with a spark-ignition reciprocating engine. A high-tension
magneto contains an alternating current generator that produces a flow of
primary current, and a set of breaker points that interrupts this current the instant
the spark is needed.
When the primary current stops flowing, its magnetic field collapses. The
collapsing lines of flux cut across many thousands of turns of wire in the
secondary winding of the built-in magneto coil and induces a high voltage into
it. The distributor, which is a high-voltage selector switch, directs the high
voltage from the magneto coil to the proper spark plug for ignition.

50% nickel.
Hi-Shear rivet. A patented, high-strength, pin-type fastener used in aircraft
construction. Hi-Shear rivets are often used in place of bolts in strong,
lightweight structure. The pin of a Hi-Shear rivet has a thin, flat head on one end
and a groove around its shank at the other end. The pin is pressed through a
tight-fitting hole in the pieces of metal to be joined, and a soft steel or aluminum
alloy collar is slipped over its grooved end. A swaging tool forces the collar into
the groove and pulls the head of the rivet tight against the metal through which it
is installed.

which keeps aircraft within a specified airspace while awaiting further clearance
from air traffic control.
“Hold for release” (air traffic control). A phrase used by ATC to delay an
aircraft for traffic management reasons; i.e., weather, traffic volume, etc. Hold
for release instructions (including departure delay information) are used to
inform a pilot or a controller (either directly or through an authorized relay) that
an IFR departure clearance is not valid until a release time or additional

signs located alongside the hold-short point.
hole (semiconductor device). A concept used to explain the action that takes
place in a semiconductor material. A hole is a location in a covalent atomic bond
where there should be an electron, but where there is none.
Holes are the mobile charges in a piece of P-type semiconductor material, and
since they are located where an electron (a negative charge) should be, they act
as positive charges. See acceptor atom.

an abrasive stone to produce a series of grooves of microscopic depth and
uniform pattern. The honed pattern holds oil to lubricate the cylinder walls.
Hooke’s law. A basic law of physics that deals with the relationship between
stress and strain. Hooke’s law explains that the strain within a material (the
amount the material deforms) is directly proportional to the amount of stress that
causes the deformation. This is true only until the material reaches its elastic
limit.
When the stress that strains a material within its elastic limit is removed, the
material will return to its original size and shape. But, if the material is strained
beyond its elastic limit, it will not return to its original size and shape, but will be
permanently deformed.

opening, and it feeds out as needed through the small opening.
hopper-type oil tank (reciprocating engine oil tank). An oil tank, or reservoir, in
which there is a hopper around the outlet from the tank. When oil dilution is
being used, the diluted oil fills the hopper before the engine is shut down. Then,

when the engine is started, the diluted oil is the first used. This diluted oil helps
start the engine in cold weather. As soon as the oil begins to warm up, oil around
the outside of the hopper feeds into the engine.
horizon. The line we see that forms an apparent boundary between the earth and
sky.
horizontal component of lift (HCL) (aerodynamics). A component of flight that
works along with the vertical component in turning flight, HCL is the lift that
acts horizontally and in opposition to inertia (centrifugal force). The horizontal
component of lift creates a force directed inward toward the center of rotation,
which is known as centripetal force. See also vertical component of lift.
horizontally opposed engine (reciprocating engine). A reciprocating engine in
which the cylinders are arranged in two banks separated by 180°, with the
cylinders and crankcase mounted in the aircraft so they are flat. The cylinders
are staggered, with one bank slightly ahead of the other. Staggering the cylinders
allows each piston to be connected to a separate throw of the crankshaft.
Horizontally opposed engines are called flat engines.
horizontal needle of the cross-pointer indicator (aircraft instrument). The
horizontal needle of the cross-pointer indicator of the Instrument Landing
System (ILS) shows the pilot the vertical position of the aircraft as it descends
along the glide slope for an instrument approach.
If the horizontal needle is above the center mark, or doughnut, the aircraft is
below the glide slope, and the pilot should fly upward. If the needle is below the
doughnut, the aircraft is too high and should descend. The glide slope is
sometimes called the glide path. See illustration for glide slope.
horizontal plane. A horizontal plane is one that is perpendicular to the
gravitational field of the earth.
horizontal situation indicator. See HSI.
horizontal stabilizer (airplane control). The fixed horizontal surface on the tail of

corrosion attack caused by the presence of a salt layer on the metal. This may be
seen on the blades and vanes of gas turbines which are generally made of nickelor cobalt-base alloys.
hot dimpling (sheet metal construction process). A process used to dimple, or
indent, the hole into which a flush rivet is to be installed. Some metals, such as
magnesium and the harder aluminum alloys, cannot be dimpled cold because
they are likely to crack. These metals must be hot dimpled.
Hot dimpling equipment consists of a pair of electrically heated dies with a
pilot that goes through the rivet hole. The pilot is passed through the hole, and
the heated dies are pressed together. The dies heat the metal enough to soften it
and force it into the shape of the die. This is the proper shape for the rivet head.

hot spark plug (reciprocating engine ignition component). A spark plug with a
long path for heat to travel from the nose core insulator to the spark plug shell.
Because the heat must travel a long distance before it is transferred into the
cylinder head, the nose core stays quite hot. Hot spark plugs are used in lowpowered engines because a cold spark plug would not get hot enough to burn the
contaminants out of its firing-end cavity. If these contaminants are not burned
out, they will foul the spark plug and prevent it from firing properly.
hot spot. A location on an airport movement area with a history of risk for
potential collision or runway incursion, where heightened attention by pilots and
drivers is necessary. Hot spot location information can be found in the Chart
Supplement U.S.
hot stamping. A method of marking plastic materials, cloth, or paper by using
heated metal dies. The heated dies force molten metal leaf (extremely thin sheets
of metal) into the surface of the material.

between the valve stem and the rocker arm of a radial engine when the engine is
operating at its normal temperature. The hot, or running, clearance is much
greater than the cold clearance, and it is measured only when adjusting the valve

timing. After the timing is properly adjusted, using the hot clearance, all of the
valves are set to the much smaller cold clearance.
hot wire. The common term used for a wire connected to the source of electrical
power.
hot-wire ammeter. An ammeter used for measuring high-frequency alternating
current. The current flows through a fine wire held under a slight tension, and
the heat produced by the current causes the wire to expand and increase its
length. As the wire lengthens, it moves a pointer across the dial to show the
amount of current flowing through the wire.
hot-wire anemometer. A form of windspeed indicator in which the wind whose
speed being measured passes over a wire heated by an electrical current. The
amount of heat the moving air removes from the wire is proportional to the wind
speed.
hot-wire cutter. A cutter used to shape blocks of Styrofoam. The wire is
stretched tight between the arms of a frame and heated by electrical current. The
hot wire melts its way through the foam.
hourmeter (aircraft instrument). An instrument installed in many aircraft to show
the actual number of hours the engine has operated. The hourmeter is an
electrical clock that starts when the engine oil pressure builds up, and runs until
the engine is shut down and the oil pressure drops to zero.

forms in the same or similar location. In locating thermals for soaring flight it is
worth noting where thermals were found previously, as some areas tend to be
consistent thermal sources.

hovering in ground effect (helicopter operation). A helicopter hovering in
ground effect (IGE) is in flight, but it is not moving over the ground, and it is
flying at a height equal to or less than the span of its rotor above the surface. A
helicopter can hover in ground effect at a higher density altitude than it can
hover out of ground effect.
hovering out of ground effect (helicopter operation). A helicopter hovering out
of ground effect (OGE) is in flight, but it is not moving over the ground, and it is
flying at a height above the ground greater than the span of its rotor.

the body, the effects of emotions, and the interaction and communication with
the other participants of the aviation community, such as other crewmembers
and air traffic control personnel.
human nature. The general psychological characteristics, feelings, and
behavioral traits shared by all humans; that is, the qualities common to humanity
and the elements that are a basic part of the life of all humans, distinguishing it
from other animal life. These qualities and elements help explain the motivations
and attitudes in people’s behavior and how they learn in a setting such as flight
training.

either side of a stable condition. The control system seeks, or hunts for, its stable
condition, but each time it approaches it, it overshoots and must seek it again.
hunting (helicopter rotor). The oscillation of a helicopter rotor blade back and
forth about its lead-lag hinge as the blade is rotating.
hurricane (meteorology). A violent tropical cyclone caused by air flowing into a
low-pressure area. Winds blow in a hurricane at a speed of 74 miles per hour (64
knots) or greater. This is a Beaufort force 12 (the highest force). Hurricanes

flow of fluid if a line should break. There are two types of hydraulic fuses: one
type shuts off the flow after a given volume of fluid flows, and the other type
shuts off the flow any time the rate of flow becomes excessive.
hydraulic lock (reciprocating engine condition). A condition in which oil drains
into the lower cylinders of an engine and leaks past the piston rings to fill the
combustion chamber. If this oil is not removed before the engine is started, it can
cause serious damage.
The propellers on all radial, inverted V-, and inverted in-line engines must be
pulled through by hand before they are cranked with the starter to be sure that
none of the cylinders have hydraulic lock.
hydraulic motor. A hydraulic actuator that converts fluid pressure into rotary
motion. Hydraulic motors have an advantage in aircraft installations over electric
motors, because they can operate in a stalled condition without the danger of a
fire. Hydraulic motors may be of the gear, piston, or vane type.

ensure a positive flow of fluid to the pumps.
hydraulics. The branch of science or technology that deals with the transmission
of power through an incompressible fluid, such as oil or water.
hydraulic system. A fluid power system that transmits power or force through an
incompressible fluid, such as oil. A complete hydraulic system contains a
reservoir to hold the fluid, a pump to move the fluid, valves to control the flow
of fluid, and actuators to produce the mechanical force. All of the components
are connected together with either rigid or flexible fluid lines.
hydraulic valve lifter (reciprocating engine component). A hydraulic device in

the valve train of certain aircraft reciprocating engines. When the cam follower
is on top of a cam lobe, the intake or exhaust valve is held open by a cushion of
oil inside the valve lifter. A specific amount of this oil leaks out while the valve
is open, and when the valve closes, a spring pushes the piston up and oil is
pulled into the lifter to replace that which was lost. The continual leakage and
replenishment of the oil in the hydraulic valve lifter keeps all clearance out of
the valve operating system.
hydrocarbon. An organic compound which contains only carbon and hydrogen.
The vast majority of fossil fuels such as gasoline and turbine-engine fuel are
hydrocarbons.
hydrodynamic forces. Forces relating to the motion of fluids and the effects of
fluids acting on solid bodies in motion relative to them.
hydrodynamic lift. For seaplanes, the upward force generated by the motion of
the hull or floats through the water. When the seaplane is at rest on the surface, it
is supported by a hydrostatic force, but as it moves through the water,
hydrodynamic lift begins to support its weight.
hydrodynamics. The branch of science or technology that deals with forces
produced by incompressible fluids in motion.
hydrofoils. Flat or airfoil-shaped plates attached to struts below the hull of a
hydrofoil watercraft.
hydrofoil vessel. A watercraft with a conventional hull which supports it when it
is still or moving at a slow speed, but when traveling at a high speed,
hydrodynamic lift produced by hydrofoils below the hull lifts the vessel out of
the water, greatly decreasing the drag and allowing the vessel to travel at a
higher speed.
hydrogen. A colorless, highly flammable, lighter-than-air, gaseous chemical
element. Hydrogen’s symbol is H, its atomic number is 1, and its atomic weight
is 1.00794. Hydrogen is the lightest of all of the chemical elements.
An atom of hydrogen has one proton and no neutrons in its nucleus, and
spinning around this nucleus is only one electron. A molecule of hydrogen gas is
made up of two atoms of hydrogen (H2). Hydrogen gas is colorless, tasteless and
lighter than air. It is used as a fuel gas for welding.

hydrogen bomb. A nuclear weapon in which two light elements such as
deuterium and tritium are forced together under extreme conditions of heat and
pressure. When two of the light nuclei join together to form a heavier nucleus
(this is called atomic, or nuclear, fusion), a tremendous amount of heat is
released. A hydrogen bomb is far more powerful than the original atomic bomb.
hydrogen brazing. A form of brazing in which hydrogen is used as the fuel gas.
hydrogen embrittlement. A condition in which certain types of metal become
brittle from absorbing hydrogen while they are being electroplated.
hydrogen peroxide. A heavy, colorless, unstable liquid used as a bleaching
agent, an antiseptic, and a fuel for liquid-propellant rocket engines.
hydrological cycle. The continuous circulation of water within the Earth’s
hydrosphere driven by solar radiation.
hydrolysis. The change in a chemical substance caused by water.
hydromechanical. Any device that combines fluid pressures with mechanical
actions to achieve a desired result. In a hydromechanical fuel control used for a
turbine engine, hydraulic servos are used in conjunction with mechanical
linkages.
hydrometeor (meteorology). A general term for particles of liquid water or ice,
such as rain, fog, frost, etc., formed by modification of water vapor in the
atmosphere. The term hydrometeor also applies to sea spray or blowing snow,
which are water or ice particles lifted from the earth by the wind.
hydrometer. An instrument used to measure the specific gravity of a liquid. A
float-type hydrometer consists of a specially weighted float with a graduated
stem above the weight. The specific gravity, or density, of the liquid determines
the amount the float sinks, and the number on the stem even with the surface of
the liquid is the specific gravity of the liquid.

hydroplaning. A condition that can exist when a high-speed airplane is landed on
a water-covered runway. High-speed airplanes use relatively narrow, highpressure tires that, when the brakes are applied, try to lock up and skid on the
surface of the water in much the same way a water ski rides on the surface. A
hydroplaning tire can develop enough heat to ruin it. Effective anti-skid brake
systems prevent hydroplaning.
hydropneumatic. Equipment that uses both hydraulic and pneumatic forces.
Certain types of control systems use pneumatic inputs to operate hydraulic
valves. A pneumatic input requires very little power, and it can control a
hydraulic output that produces a great deal of force.
hydro-ski. A hydrofoil mounted below the hull of a flying boat. As the flying
boat begins to move through the water, hydrodynamic lift produced by the
hydro-ski lifts the hull out of the water. When the hull is out of the water, the
drag is decreased, and the flying boat can quickly accelerate to takeoff speed.
hydrosorb (landing gear component). A hydraulic shock absorber used with a
bungee shock cord landing gear to prevent rebound.
hydrostatic testing (gas cylinder test). A type of test required for cylinders used
to carry compressed gases. The cylinder is filled with water under a pressure
higher than that of the gas it is to carry, and this pressure is held for a specified
length of time. Cylinders are hydrostatically tested rather than being tested with
compressed air because, if the cylinder should fail, the incompressible water will
not cause an explosion, as would occur if a cylinder filled with compressed air
should fail.
When oxygen cylinders are hydrostatically tested for installation in an aircraft,
they are filled with water and pressurized to 5 ⁄3 of their working pressure.

Standard-weight cylinders (DOT 3AA) must be hydrostatically tested every five
years, and lightweight cylinders (DOT 3HT) must be tested every three years.
hydroxide. A chemical compound consisting of a metal, usually a base, or a
nonmetal, usually an acid, and a negative hydroxyl ion (OH). Hydroxides are
found in both organic and inorganic chemicals. Some of the more familiar
hydroxides are sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and potassium hydroxide (KOH).
hygrograph (meteorology). The record produced by a continuous-recording
hygrometer.
hygrometer. An instrument used to measure the amount of moisture in the air to
determine its humidity.
hygroscopic material. A material that absorbs moisture from the air. Silica gel is
a hygroscopic material used to protect delicate equipment from damage caused
by moisture in the air. When bags of silica gel are placed in the equipment, any
moisture in the air is absorbed by the silica gel, and the air is kept dry.
hyperbola (mathematical curve). A plane curve traced by a point that moves in
such a way that the difference of its distance from two fixed points, called foci,
remains constant.
hyperbolic navigation system. A system of electronic navigation in which a
master and a remotely located slave station transmit a signal simultaneously. The
difference between the time the signals from the two stations are received in an
aircraft is carefully measured and plotted on a chart of hyperbolic curves. This
information gives a line of position along which the aircraft is located.
An electronic computer determines the position by plotting lines of position
from two sets of stations. The aircraft is located at the latitude and longitude the
lines cross.

hyper engines. A series of experimental high-performance aircraft engines built
with U.S. Army and Navy financing in the early 1930s. The goal of these
engines, which had been unattainable up to that time, was to develop one
horsepower for each cubic inch of piston displacement.
hypersonic engine. An engine designed to operate at speeds above Mach 5.00.
hypersonic flight. Flight at air speeds greater than five times the local speed of
sound, more than Mach 5.0.
hyperventilation. A breathing problem caused by too little carbon dioxide in the
lungs. Hyperventilation causes a person to breathe too rapidly, and this results in
dizziness and may even lead to unconsciousness.
hypotenuse (mathematics). The side of a right triangle opposite the right angle.

hypoxia. A physiological condition in which a person is deprived of the needed
oxygen. The effects of hypoxia normally disappear as soon as the person is able

to breathe air that contains sufficient oxygen.
Histotoxic. The inability of the cells to effectively use oxygen. Plenty of
oxygen is being transported to the cells that need it, but they are unable to make
use of it.
Hypemic. A type of hypoxia that is a result of oxygen deficiency in the blood,
rather than a lack of inhaled oxygen. It can be caused by a variety of factors.
Hypemic means “not enough blood.”
Hypoxic. This type of hypoxia is a result of insufficient oxygen available to the
lungs. A decrease of oxygen molecules at sufficient pressure can lead to hypoxic
hypoxia.
Stagnant. A type of hypoxia that results when the oxygen-rich blood in the
lungs isn’t moving, for one reason or another, to the tissues that need it.
hysteresis. A condition in which a physical action lags behind its cause. A spring
is often slow to return to its original length when the load is removed. This slow
return is caused by friction within the material of which the spring is made. This
internal friction causes hysteresis.

hysteresis error (instrument indication error). An instrument error that causes a
difference in the readings of an instrument when the indicated values are
increasing, compared with the readings at the same point when the values are
decreasing. Hysteresis error is caused by internal friction in the instrument
mechanism.
hysteresis loop (magnetic materials). A curve showing the way flux density in a
magnetic material varies with the magnetizing force applied to it. The shape of a
hysteresis loop gives an indication of the magnetic characteristics of the
material.

IA (Inspection Authorization). An authorization issued by the Federal Aviation
Administration to certain licensed and experienced aviation maintenance
technicians that allows them to perform annual and progressive inspections. This
authorization also allows them to approve aircraft for return to service after
certain types of major repairs and major alterations.
IAF (initial approach fix) (air traffic control). The fixes depicted on the
instrument approach procedure charts that identify the beginning of the initial
approach segment(s).
IAP (instrument approach procedure). A series of predetermined maneuvers for
the orderly transfer of an aircraft under instrument flight conditions from the
beginning of the initial approach to a landing or to a point from which a landing
may be made visually.
IAS (indicated airspeed). The speed an aircraft is moving through the air as is
shown on the airspeed indicator, before any corrections for errors or nonstandard
conditions are made.
I-beam. A piece of structural material having a cross-sectional shape that
resembles the letter “I.” I-beams used in aircraft structure may be extruded or
built up from aluminum alloys, or they may be made of wood. Wooden I-beams
may be either built up of several pieces of wood or shaped by removing some of
the wood from the sides of the beam with a router.

IC (integrated circuit). A combination of electronic components built onto a
single substrate of semiconductor material. Transistors, diodes, capacitors, and
resistors are all built onto a tiny chip and mounted in a protective package that
allows the circuit to connect with other components or devices. Logic gates,
rectifiers, amplifiers, microprocessors, and semiconductor memory circuits can
all be built as integrated circuits. The development of integrated circuits has
made miniature electronics possible.
ICA. See initial climb area.
ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization). A specialized agency of the
United Nations whose objective is to develop the principles and techniques of
international air navigation and to foster planning and development of
international civil air transport. The term ICAO is normally pronounced as a
single word (eye-kay-o), rather than using the entire name or the initials.
icebox rivet (aircraft fastener). A solid aircraft rivet made of 2017 or 2024
aluminum alloy. These rivets are too hard to drive in the condition they are
received from the manufacturer, and they must be heat-treated to soften them.
They are heated in a furnace and then quenched in water. Immediately after
quenching, they are soft, but within a few hours at room temperature, they
become quite hard. Hardening can be delayed for several days by immediately
placing the rivets in a subfreezing icebox and holding them at this low
temperature until they are used.
ice bridging. A spark plug failure that occurs when a reciprocating engine is
started in extremely cold weather. When a cylinder fires, the fuel-air mixture is
converted into carbon dioxide and water vapor. The water vapor condenses on
the spark plug electrodes and forms ice that bridges the electrode gap and
prevents the plug firing until the ice is melted. This normally requires removing
the spark plugs from the engine.

ice crystals (meteorology). A type of precipitation composed of unbranched ice
crystals in the form of needles, columns, or plates. Ice crystals normally have a
slight downward motion and may fall from a cloudless sky.
ice fog (meteorology). An obstruction to visibility caused by tiny ice crystals,
rather than the tiny droplets of water that make up ordinary fog. Ice fog occurs at
very low temperatures and may cause a halo.
ice light (aircraft light). A light mounted on the fuselage of an airplane in such a
way that it shines on the leading edge of the wing. This light allows the pilot to
check for the buildup of ice on the wing while flying through icing conditions at
night.
ice needles (meteorology). A long, thin ice crystal with a hexagonal cross
section.
ice pellets (meteorology). Small, transparent or translucent, round or irregularly
shaped pellets of ice. Ice pellets may be hard grains that rebound on striking a
hard surface or may be pellets of snow encased in ice.
ice. The solid state of water. If enough heat is removed from liquid water to drop
its temperature to 0°C (32°F), the molecules moving about in the water will slow
down enough that the water will change from a liquid into a solid. This solid
form of water is called ice.
icing (meteorology). Ice forming on an aircraft. Classifications of icing are:
clear, rime, and glaze, and can be reported as trace, light, moderate, and severe.
icing, light (meteorology). Icing for which the rate of accumulation may create a
problem if flight is prolonged in that environment (over 1 hour). Occasional use
of deicing and/or anti-icing equipment removes and/or prevents this
accumulation, and light icing does not present a problem if deicing/anti-icing
equipment is used.
icing, mixed (meteorology). Ice that forms on a surface when drops very in size,
or when liquid drops are intermingled with snow or ice particles.
icing, moderate (meteorology). Icing conditions in which the rate of
accumulation is such that even short encounters become potentially hazardous
and the use of deicing/anti-icing equipment or diversion is necessary.

icing, severe (meteorology). Icing conditions in which the rate of accumulation
is such that ice protection systems fail to remove the accumulation of ice, or ice
accumulates in locations not normally prone to icing, such as areas aft of
protected surfaces and any other areas identified by the manufacturer. Immediate
exit from the condition is necessary.
icing, trace (meteorology). Icing as it begins to become perceptible, with the rate
of accumulation slightly greater than sublimation. Deicing/ant-icing equipment
is not utilized unless trace icing is encountered for an extended period of time
(over 1 hour).
ident (air traffic control). A request by ATC for a pilot to activate the radar
beacon transponder identification feature.
ident feature (radar beacon transponder). The special feature in the Air Traffic
Control Radar Beacon System (ATCRBS) equipment used to immediately
distinguish one displayed beacon target from other beacon targets.
identification zone. An airspace of defined dimensions extending upwards from
the surface of the earth within which certain rules apply for the security control
of air traffic.
IDG (integrated drive generator). An AC generator installed on turbine engines.
An IDG incorporates a brushless, three-phase AC generator and a constant-speed
drive in a single component.
idiot light. A warning light, whose proper name is nondiscrete indicator, used
instead of an indicating instrument. Some aircraft have “idiot lights” rather than
ammeters, to alert the pilot when the generator is not producing adequate
voltage. Other idiot lights indicate such conditions as low oil pressure and cabin
heater malfunctions.
idle cut-off (reciprocating engine fuel metering system). The position of the
mixture control in a reciprocating engine fuel metering system that shuts off all
fuel to the cylinders. Most aircraft engine fuel metering systems have a mixture
control that allows the pilot to adjust the fuel-air mixture ratio to compensate for
changes in air density as the aircraft goes up in altitude. When this mixture
control is placed in the idle cut-off position, all fuel is shut off to the cylinders
and the engine stops running.

idle mixture (reciprocating engine fuel metering system). The fuel-air mixture
ratio used by an aircraft engine while it is operating at its idle speed. The uneven
distribution of the fuel-air mixture to the cylinders at idle speed requires the idle
mixture ratio to be richer than that required for best burning.
idle mixture adjustment (reciprocating engine fuel metering system adjustment).
Adjusting the fuel-air mixture metered to the engine at idle speed.
idler gear (gear train). A gear used to reverse the direction of rotation of another
gear without changing its speed of rotation. An idler gear does not add nor take
away mechanical advantage from the gear train.
idler pulley (belt-drive system). A pulley in a belt-drive system used to adjust the
tension on the belt that joins a drive pulley with a driven pulley. The idler pulley
does not change the direction of rotation of either pulley, nor does it change the
speed relationship between the pulleys.
idle speed. The lowest speed at which an engine operates smoothly when it is not
carrying any type of mechanical load. Idle speed is measured in revolutions per
minute (RPM).
idle thrust (gas turbine engine). The thrust produced by an aircraft gas turbine
engine when the power control lever is pulled back to the idle stop. 14 CFR Part
1: “The jet thrust obtained with the engine power control lever set at the stop for
the least thrust position at which it can be placed.”
idling current (electronic equipment). Current flowing in an electronic circuit
when there is no input signal requiring the system to act. Idling current, also
called quiescent current, is normally much less than the operating current of the
system.
idling position (seaplane floats). See displacement position (seaplane floats).
IFF (identification, friend or foe). An electronic identification system that is the
forerunner of the modern radar beacon transponder used by air traffic controllers
to identify specific aircraft. IFF, developed in the latter part of World War II, is
an electronic pulse system in which interrogation pulses of electrical energy are
transmitted from a ground station and received in the aircraft.
If the airborne equipment is set to respond with the proper code, the IFF
identifies the aircraft as friendly. But if the equipment does not reply with the
correct code, the ground station is alerted to the fact that the indications received

on its radarscope may be caused by a foe, or enemy. The principles of IFF
equipment apply to other pulse navigation systems, especially aircraft radar
beacon transponders and distance measuring equipment (DME).
IFIM (International Flight Information Manual). A publication designed
primarily as a pilot’s preflight planning guide for flights into foreign airspace
and for flights returning to the U.S. from foreign locations.
“If no transmission received for [time]” (air traffic control). A phrase used by
ATC in radar approaches to prefix procedures which should be followed by the
pilot in event of lost communications.
IFR (instrument flight rules). Rules and regulations established by the Federal
Aviation Administration to govern flight under conditions in which flight by
outside visual reference is not safe. Instrument flight rules govern the flight of
aircraft along the federally-controlled airways and airports, and this flight is
directed and controlled by operators on the ground. Flight according to
instrument flight rules depends upon flying by reference to instruments in the
cockpit, and navigation is done by reference to electronic signals.
IFR aircraft (air traffic control). An aircraft conducting flight in accordance with
instrument flight rules.
IFR conditions. 14 CFR Part 1: “Weather conditions below the minimums
allowed for flight under visual flight rules.”
IFR military training routes (air traffic control). Routes used by the Department
of Defense and associated Reserve and Air Guard units for the purpose of
conducting low-altitude navigation and tactical training in both IFR and VFR
weather conditions below 10,000 feet MSL at airspeeds in excess of 250 knots
IAS.
IFR over-the-top. 14 CFR Part 1: “With respect to the operation of aircraft,
means the operation of an aircraft over-the-top on an IFR flight plan when
cleared by air traffic control to maintain ‘VFR conditions’ or ‘VFR conditions
on top’.”
IFR takeoff minimums and departure procedures (air traffic control). Minimums
listed in 14 CFR Part 91, prescribing standard takeoff rules for certain civil
users. At some airports, obstructions or other factors require the establishment of
nonstandard takeoff minimums, departure procedures, or both, to assist pilots in

avoiding obstacles during climb to the minimum en route altitude. Those airports
are listed in NOS/DOD Instrument Approach Charts (IAPs) under a section
entitled “IFR Takeoff Minimums and Departure Procedures.” The NOS/DOD
IAP chart legend illustrates the symbol used to alert the pilot to nonstandard
takeoff minimums and departure procedures.
When departing IFR from such airports or from any airports where there are no
departure procedures, SIDs or ATC facilities available, pilots should advise ATC
of any departure limitations. Controllers may query a pilot to determine
acceptable departure directions, turns, or headings after takeoff. Pilots should be
familiar with the departure procedures and must assure that their aircraft can
meet or exceed any specified climb gradients.
IFWP. Intermediate Fix Waypoint.
IGFET (insulated gate field effect transistor). A field-effect transistor whose gate
is insulated from the channel by a layer of silicon oxide.

igniter (gas turbine engine component). A component in a gas turbine engine
used to ignite the fuel-air mixture when the engine is being started. Some
igniters resemble spark plugs used in reciprocating engines, while others are
glow plugs heated yellow-hot with electrical current.
igniter (hot-air balloon). A welding striker, piezo sparker, matches, or other
means used to ignite the balloon pilot flame.
ignition (heat engine operation). The procedure by which the temperature of a
portion of the fuel-air mixture in the engine is raised high enough for the
hydrocarbon fuel to begin combining with the oxygen in the air. This heat is
normally provided by an electrical spark.

ignition harness (reciprocating engine ignition system component). The
complete set of high-tension cables, terminals, and connectors used to carry high
voltage from the magnetos to the various spark plugs in the engine.
ignition timing (reciprocating engine). The timing of the ignition spark with
respect to the piston position in the cylinder of a reciprocating engine. For the
most power to be produced, the fuel-air mixture must be ignited while the piston
is still moving upward on the compression stroke. This allows time for the
burning mixture to produce its maximum push on the piston just as it starts down
on the power stroke.
The correct piston position for ignition varies with the speed of the engine, and
the ignition timing on automobile engines is variable; but nearly all aircraft
engines have fixed timing. The spark occurs at the same position of the piston
regardless of the engine conditions. Fixed timing is a performance compromise,
but fixed-timing ignition systems are less complicated than variable-timing
systems.
ignitron (electrical component). A special high-current rectifier tube. In each
cycle of operation of an ignitron tube, an ignitor dips into a pool of mercury, and
as it is withdrawn, it creates an arc which produces ionized mercury vapor that
conducts a large amount of current.
I-head cylinder (reciprocating engine). The cylinder of a reciprocating engine
with both the intake and exhaust valves mounted in the head. I-head cylinders
are also called valve-in-head cylinders.
IHP (indicated horsepower). The theoretical horsepower a reciprocating engine
is developing. The horsepower an engine actually delivers to its output shaft is
called brake horsepower (BHP). A large amount of power is used to rotate the
engine and compress the air in the cylinders. This power is called friction
horsepower (FHP). Indicated horsepower is the sum of the brake horsepower and
the friction horsepower: IHP = BHP + FHP.
illumination. Light energy that falls on a given surface area.
illustrated parts list (service information). An exploded view of an assembly in
which all of the component parts are laid out so each can be identified. Each part
is coded with a letter or number, and a table is included with the drawing, giving
the name and correct number for each part and the quantity of the parts needed
for the assembly.

illustrated talk (in learning process). An oral presentation in which the speaker
relies heavily on visual aids to convey ideas to the listeners.
ILS (instrument landing system). A special type of electronic guidance system
used to allow aircraft to land when the ceiling and visibility are too low for a
safe visual approach to the runway. An ILS is made up of four basic parts: the
localizer, glide slope, marker beacons, and approach lights. The localizer
produces a narrow electronic path extending out along the center line of the
instrument runway, to direct the pilot laterally as he approaches the runway.
The glide slope produces a narrow electronic path extending upward from the
approach end of the instrument runway at an angle of approximately three
degrees. The glide slope directs the pilot vertically as the aircraft approaches the
end of the runway.
The marker beacons produce highly directional radio signals to identify the
position of the aircraft along the localizer path. When the aircraft is directly over
a marker beacon, a distinctive tone is received on the radio, and a colored light
on the instrument panel flashes the proper code.
The approach lights are a series of high-intensity lights located along the
approach path to help the pilot transition from flying by instruments to flying by
visual reference as the aircraft breaks out of the overcast.
ILS categories. Categories of instrument flight allowed at airports equipped with
the following types of instrument landing systems:
ILS Category I. An ILS approach procedure which provides for approach to a
height above touchdown of not less than 200 feet and with runway visual range
of not less than 1,800 feet. (Note: “Special Authorization Category I” provides
for approach to a height above touchdown of not less than 150 feet and with
runway visual range of not less than 1,400 feet, HUD to DH.)
ILS Category II. An ILS approach procedure which provides for approach to a
height above touchdown of not less than 100 feet and with runway visual range
of not less than 1,200 feet, with autoland or HUD to touchdown, and noted on
authorization RVR 1,000 feet. (Note: “Special Authorization Category II with
Reduced Lighting” provides for approach to a height above touchdown of not
less than 100 feet and with runway visual range of not less than 1,200 feet with
autoland or HUD to touchdown, and noted on authorization (no touchdown zone
and centerline lighting are required).)
ILS Category IIIA. An ILS approach procedure which provides for approach
without a decision height minimum and with runway visual range of not less

than 700 feet.
ILS Category IIIB. An ILS approach procedure which provides for approach
without a decision height minimum and with runway visual range of not less
than 150 feet.
ILS Category IIIC. An ILS approach procedure which provides for approach
without a decision height minimum and without runway visual range minimum.
ILS PRM approach. An instrument landing system (ILS) approach conducted to
parallel runways whose extended centerlines are separated by less than 4,300
feet and the parallel runways have a Precision Runway Monitoring (PRM)
system that permits simultaneous independent ILS approaches.
IMC (instrument meteorological conditions) (air traffic control). Meteorological
conditions expressed in terms of visibility, distance from cloud, and ceiling less
than the minimums specified for visual meteorological conditions.
imaging sensor payloads (UAS operations). The most common UAV payloads
involve carrying a camera or other type of imaging sensor. The three basic
configurations of these payloads are for surveying, FPV reconnaissance, and
FPV pilot cam.
IMEP (indicated mean effective pressure). The average pressure existing inside
the cylinder of a reciprocating engine during its power stroke. IMEP, expressed
in pounds per square inch, is a measured pressure which contrasts with brake
mean effective pressure, BMEP, which is a computed pressure. The horsepower
found when IMEP is used in the horsepower formula is indicated horsepower,
IHP.
“Immediately” (air traffic control). A term used by ATC when such action
compliance is required to avoid an imminent situation.
immersion heater. An electrical heater used to heat liquids by immersing
(submerging) the heater in the liquid.
immiscible. Not able to mix. Liquids are immiscible if they will not mix with
each other. Water and oil are immiscible. If a bottle containing both water and
oil is agitated, the oil and water will form an emulsion. But when the bottle sits
for a while without further agitation, the oil and water will separate, the oil rising
to the top of the water.

impact extrusion. A form of extrusion made by forcing cold metal through a die
by striking it a hard blow. This blow comes from a punch driven at a high
velocity.
impact ice. Ice that forms on an aircraft flying through freezing rain or other
visible moisture when the air temperature is in the freezing range (between 0°
and −15°C). Impact ice forms on the leading edges of the wing and tail surfaces
and disturbs the smooth flow of air over these surfaces. Impact ice also forms on
the engine inlet air filters and can stop an engine functioning unless inlet air is
taken from an alternate source. Impact ice forming on the inlet air duct of a jet
engine can break off and be pulled through the engine, causing severe damage to
the compressor blades.
impact pressure. Pressure resulting when moving air is stopped. Impact pressure
picked up by a pitot tube is called pitot pressure.
impact wrench. A power-driven tool used to install and remove nuts, bolts, and
screws. The torque delivered to the fastener by an impact wrench is in a series of
sharp blows or impacts.
impedance (Z). The total opposition to the flow of alternating current caused by
the combined effect of resistance, capacitance, and inductance in a circuit.
Impedance (Z) is found by adding, as vectors, the resistance (R) of the circuit
with the combined values of the inductive reactance (XL) and capacitive
reactance (XC) in the circuit. If the capacitive reactance is larger than the
inductive reactance, the formula for impedance is:

If the inductive reactance is larger than the capacitive reactance, the formula for
impedance is:

impedance coupling (electronic circuits). A method of using a transformer to
join, or couple, stages of an electronic device, such as an amplifier. The
impedance of the primary winding of the coupling transformer is the same as the
output impedance of the first stage, and the impedance of the secondary winding

is the same as the input impedance of the following stage. Impedance coupling is
primarily used in circuits carrying audio-frequency AC because of the limited
bandwidth of the coupling transformer.
impedance matching (electronic circuits). The process of matching the
impedance of a source of electrical power with the impedance of the load using
the power. For maximum power transfer to occur, the impedance of the source
and the impedance of the load should be the same. Transformers can be used to
match impedance. The following formula is used to relate the impedance ratio to
the turns ratio:

NP = number of turns in the primary winding
NS = number of turns in the secondary winding
ZP = impedance of the primary winding
ZS = impedance of the secondary winding
impedance matching transformer. A transformer used in an electronic circuit to
match the impedance of the load to the impedance of the source of electrical
energy.
impedance triangle. A graphic method of showing the relationship existing
between resistance, reactance, and impedance in an AC circuit. An impedance
triangle is a right triangle, with the horizontal side representing the circuit
resistance and the vertical side representing the combined capacitive and
inductive reactance in the circuit. The hypotenuse represents the circuit
impedance.
The angle formed between the hypotenuse and the horizontal side is the phase
angle (ø) of the circuit, the number of electrical degrees the current leads or lags
the voltage.

impeller (centrifugal pump). A vaned wheel used to move and add energy to a
fluid. The fluid enters the center of the impeller and is thrown outward by
centrifugal force. As the fluid leaves the impeller, it is collected in a diffuser
where it is slowed and its pressure is increased.
Impellers can move either liquids or gases. Some applications are: moving
cooling fluid through a reciprocating engine, compressing the air before it goes
into the carburetor of a reciprocating engine, and compressing the air in a gas
turbine engine.
imperial gallon. A measure of volume used in the United Kingdom for liquid or
dry substances. One imperial gallon is equal to 4.545 liters or 1.2 U.S. gallons.
impingement starter (gas turbine engine starter). The simplest type of starter
used to start a gas turbine engine. A stream of compressed air, directed against
the turbine blades or onto the centrifugal compressor, spins the compressor fast
enough to start the engine.
implode. To burst inwardly. Electron tubes, such as the cathode-ray tubes used
in television sets and computer displays, have the air evacuated from them so the
pressure of the air outside the tube is much greater than the pressure inside the
tube. If the glass envelope of the tube cracks, outside air will rush violently onto
the tube and the tube will implode.
improper fraction (mathematics). A common fraction in which the numerator,
the number above the line, is greater than the denominator, the number below
the line.
impulse coupling (magneto component). A spring-loaded coupling between a
magneto and an aircraft reciprocating engine that causes the magneto to produce
a hot and late spark for starting the engine. The rotating magnet in a magneto
must be turned at a fast rate to produce a hot spark, but when the engine is being

started, the magneto turns slowly. Arms inside the impulse coupling contact stop
pins in the magneto housing and hold the magnet while the crankshaft turns. A
heavy, flat spring winds up as the crankshaft continues to turn, with the magnet
held stationary. When the crankshaft turns about thirty degrees past the point at
which ignition normally occurs, a cam forces the arms off the stop pins, and the
spring spins the magnet at a fast rate. When the magnet spins, it produces a hot
spark. And since the spark occurs late, the piston is moving downward,
preventing the engine kicking back. As soon as the engine is running normally,
counterweights on the arms sling outward and hold the arms in, away from the
stop pins. This keeps the impulse coupling disengaged so it has no effect on the
ignition timing for normal engine operation.
impulse-reaction turbine (gas turbine engine component). A type of turbine in
which hot, high-velocity gases produce an aerodynamic force as well as an
impulse force as they move the turbine blades in the direction needed to spin the
turbine wheel.
impulse turbine (gas turbine engine component). A form of turbine that is rotated
by air striking bucket-shaped turbine blades. An impulse turbine changes the
direction of the air flowing through it. The energy that causes this change in
direction spins the turbine. An impulse turbine does not produce a pressure drop
across the blade as the reaction turbine does.
impurity (semiconductor material). A chemical element added to silicon or
germanium to give it specific electrical characteristics. Arsenic, phosphorus, and
antimony are pentavalent elements, elements having five electrons in their
valence shell. When these elements are used as impurities, they form N-type
material because there are more electrons than are needed to form covalent
bonds within the material. Atoms of N-type material are called donor atoms.
Aluminum, boron, gallium, and indium are elements having only three
electrons in their valence shell, and when used as impurities with silicon or
germanium, produce P-type materials. P-type materials have fewer electrons
than are needed to form covalent bonds, and they accept electrons from other
materials. Atoms of P-type materials are called acceptor atoms.
inadvertent instrument meteorological conditions (IIMC). In flight, this refers to
unintentionally entering weather conditions not favorable for visual operations—
that is, IMC—and is considered an emergency situation. See also instrument
meteorological conditions (IMC).

inboard. The direction in an aircraft toward its center line.
incandescent. Glowing because of intense heat. Carbon particles inside the
cylinder of a reciprocating engine can absorb enough heat from the burning
gases to become incandescent, or glow. These incandescent particles are the
cause of preignition.
incandescent lamp. A form of electric lamp in which a white-hot, incandescent
filament produces light. The filament is enclosed in a glass bulb from which all
the air has been removed and replaced with an inert gas, such as argon. The inert
gas replaces oxygen so the filament does not burn up when it becomes white-hot.
Incandescent lamps produce a large amount of heat as well as light.
INCERFA (ICAO). A situation in which there is uncertainty as to the safety of
an aircraft and its occupants.
inch of mercury, in. Hg. A unit for measuring absolute pressure. One inch of
mercury is the amount of pressure needed to support a column of mercury one
inch (2.54 centimeters) high. Standard atmospheric pressure will support a
column of mercury 29.92 inches high.
inch-pound (measure of torque). A measure of torque, or the rotation that is
caused by a force of one pound acting one inch from the center of rotation.

of one pound moves an object a distance of one inch.
inch-pounds. See torque.
incidence board (airplane rigging tool). A triangular board used when rigging the
incidence in the wing of an airplane. The airplane is leveled, the incidence board
is held along the bottom of one of the wing root ribs, and a level is held against
the bottom of the board. When the bottom of the board is level, the wing is set to
the correct angle of incidence. See angle of incidence.
incident. An occurrence other than an accident, associated with the operation of
an aircraft, which affects or could affect the safety of operations.
inclined plane. One of the basic machines used to gain mechanical advantage.
The other basic machines are the lever and the wheel. A loading ramp which is a
plane surface forming an angle with the horizon is an inclined plane. A force of

only 100 pounds is needed to roll a 400-pound drum of oil up onto the bed of a
truck, three feet high, if the drum is rolled up a ramp 12 feet long.
inclinometer. An instrument used to measure the attitude of an aircraft relative to
the horizontal. An inclinometer is usually made of a curved glass tube, partially
filled with a clear liquid and holding a black glass ball. The curved tube is
mounted in line with either the lateral or longitudinal axis of the aircraft, so the
ball is in the center when the aircraft is level. When the aircraft tilts, the ball
remains at the low point of the tube and shows the number of degrees the aircraft
is tilted.

inclusion (metal casting defect). A defect in a metal casting caused by
nonmetallic impurities, such as carbon or sand trapped in the molten metal when
it was poured into the mold. An inclusion weakens the casting and makes proper
machining difficult.
incoherent light. Light in which the wavelengths do not have any consistent
phase relationship.
incompressible fluid. A liquid used in a fluid power system. A hydraulic system
uses an incompressible fluid, such as oil, while a pneumatic system uses a
compressible fluid, such as air.
Inconel. The registered trade name for an alloy of chromium and iron. Inconel,
which is similar to stainless steel but cannot be hardened by heat treatment, is
used for aircraft engine exhaust system components.
incursion. Entry into something. Runway incursion occurs when an aircraft
taxies onto a runway.
indefinite ceiling (meteorology). A ceiling classification denoting vertical
visibility into a surface-based obscuration.
index point (weight and balance). A location specified by the aircraft
manufacturer from which arms used in weight and balance computations are
measured. Arms measured from the index point are called index arms.

indicated airspeed. 14 CFR Part 1: “The speed of an aircraft as shown on its
pitot static airspeed indicator, calibrated to reflect standard atmospheric adiabatic
compressible flow at sea level uncorrected for airspeed system errors.”
indicated altitude. The altitude above mean sea level shown on a pressure
altimeter when the local altimeter setting is adjusted into the barometric scale.
The altimeter setting is the barometric pressure existing at the reporting station,
corrected to the value it would have if the station were located at sea level.
Indicated altitude is used by all aircraft flying below 18,000 feet. At higher
altitudes, aircraft use pressure altitude, in which the barometric scale is adjusted
to standard sea-level barometric pressure of 29.92 inches of mercury, or 1013.2
millibars.
indicating fuse holder. A type of electrical fuse holder that shows when a fuse
has blown and opened the circuit. A small neon bulb is installed in the fuse
holder, in parallel with the fuse. The resistance of a good fuse is so low that
when current flows through it, there is not enough voltage drop across it to
illuminate the bulb.
But if the fuse blows and opens the circuit, the entire system voltage is dropped
across the neon bulb, and it illuminates. The bulb does not allow enough current
to flow to damage the circuit.
indicating instrument. An instrument that shows in a visual form the value it is
sensing. There are two basic types of indicating instruments: instruments that
give their indication in an analog form, and instruments that have a digital
readout. An analog instrument has a dial and one or more pointers. The position
of the pointer on the dial is an analog, or representation, of the value the
indicator is sensing. A digital instrument uses numbers to indicate the value it is
sensing. An ordinary clock is a form of analog indicating instrument. The
number of degrees the hands have moved past their straight-up position relates to
the number of hours, minutes, or seconds that have passed since noon or
midnight. A digital clock uses just numbers to indicate the seconds, minutes, and
hours that have passed since noon or midnight.
indirect indication (instrument indication). The indication of aircraft pitch and
bank attitude by instruments other than the attitude indicator.
indirect light. Light that falls on an object after it has been reflected from a
nonlight-producing object.

indirectly heated cathode (vacuum tube component). A cathode in a vacuum tube
that is heated by a filament which is not a part of the cathode. The cathode is
made in the form of a metal tube whose surface is coated with a material that
emits electrons when it is heated. The filament, a small resistance-wire heater
inside the cathode, heats it but does not touch it. Indirectly heated cathodes allow
the filament to be heated with alternating current without causing the hum that
would be present if the AC passed through the cathode itself.
indium. A soft, malleable, silvery-white, metallic chemical element. Indium’s
symbol is In, its atomic number is 49, and its atomic weight is 114.82. Indium is
used as a plating over silver in making mirrors and as a component in
semiconductors.
induced current. Electrical current produced in a conductor when it is cut, or
crossed, by changing lines of magnetic flux. Induced current always flows in the
opposite direction to the current that produced the magnetic flux.

induced drag (aerodynamics). Aerodynamic drag produced by an airfoil when it
is producing lift. The amount of induced drag is determined by the shape and the
area of the airfoil, the angle of attack, the air density, and the speed of the air
moving over the airfoil.
induced flow (helicopter aerodynamics). The mass of air forced down by rotor
action. Most of the induced flow passes through the rotor disc.
induced voltage. Voltage generated in a conductor when it is cut, or crossed, by
lines of magnetic flux. There are three ways a conductor can be cut by lines of
magnetic flux: (1) The conductor can be held stationary and the magnetic field
moved back and forth across it. (2) The conductor can be moved back and forth
through a stationary magnetic field. (3) Both the conductor and the magnetic

field can be held stationary, but the magnetic field can be produced by
alternating current, which constantly changes its direction and strength.
inducer (turbine engine component). Rotating inlet guide vanes installed on the
center of a centrifugal compressor to pick up the inlet air and direct it at the
correct angle into the impeller blades.
inductance. The electrical characteristic of a conductor which causes a voltage to
be produced when it is cut, or crossed, by lines of magnetic flux. The basic unit
of inductance is the henry. See henry.
inductance bridge (electrical measuring instrument). A bridge-type precision
instrument used to measure an unknown inductance by comparing its inductive
reactance at a specific frequency with that produced at the same frequency by an
accurately known inductance.
induction compass. See earth induction compass.
induction furnace. An electric furnace in which the metal to be melted is heated
by the induction of high-frequency electromagnetic energy.
induction heating. A method of heating an electrically conductive material by
inducing alternating current into it. The rapidly reversing current causes the
material to get hot.
induction icing. A type of ice in the induction system that reduces the amount of
air available for combustion. The most commonly found induction icing is
carburetor icing.
induction manifold. The part of the engine that distributes intake air to the
cylinders.
induction motor. A type of alternating current motor in which the line voltage is
connected across stationary windings in the motor housing. The rotor of an
induction motor is made in the form of a “squirrel cage.” Bars of copper or
aluminum are embedded in slots in a laminated soft-iron core, and are welded to
heavy copper or aluminum plates on each end of the core. There is no electrical
connection to the rotor.
The stator winding serves as the primary of a transformer, and the bars and end
plates of the rotor act as the secondary. Current induced into the rotor bars
causes a magnetic field that reacts with the field of the stator, and this reaction
causes the rotor to turn. The magnetic field of the stator of a single-phase

induction motor does not rotate, but rather it pulses on and off. A separate start
winding is wound in the stator to produce a rotating field for starting a singlephase motor. The phase of the current in the start winding is shifted by a
capacitor or inductor so that it is different from the phase of the current in the
run winding. This shifted phase produces a rotating magnetic field.
As soon as the rotor is turning at the correct speed, the start winding is
automatically disconnected, and the inertia of the heavy rotor keeps it spinning
in the pulsing magnetic field produced by the run winding. Three-phase
induction motors do not need separate start windings, because the three separate
phase windings produce a rotating magnetic field.
induction period (aircraft finishing system condition). The period of time after a
catalyzed material, such as an epoxy or polyurethane, is mixed before it is ready
to be sprayed onto the surface of the aircraft. The induction period allows the
material to begin its curing action before it is applied.
induction system (aircraft reciprocating engine system). The entire system in an
aircraft reciprocating engine that carries air into the engine cylinders. The
induction system consists of the air filter, carburetor heater or alternate air valve,
the turbocharger, and all the piping used to carry this air into the cylinders.
induction vibrator (reciprocating engine ignition system component). An
electrical relay connected in such a way that it chops up direct current and
produces pulsating DC. The pulsating DC is sent through the primary winding of
the magneto coil where it induces a high voltage in the secondary winding. This
high voltage causes a spark to jump across the gap in a spark plug. Induction
vibrators are used with magnetos to produce a hot spark for starting the engine
when the magneto is turning slowly.
induction welding. A method of welding in which the metal is melted by heat
generated by alternating current induced into the metal.
inductive circuit. An alternating current circuit in which the inductive reactance
is greater than the capacitive reactance. Changes in the current flowing in an
inductive circuit lag behind changes in the voltage.
inductive kick. A pulse of high voltage produced across a coil when current
flowing through it is interrupted. When direct current flows through a coil, a
magnetic field surrounds each turn of wire, and this magnetic field is sustained
as long as the current flows. When the current is interrupted, the magnetic field

instantly collapses, and the lines of magnetic flux cut across each turn of the coil.
This collapsing field induces a short-duration pulse of voltage into the coil that is
many times greater than the original voltage. This pulse of high voltage is called
an inductive kick, or a transient voltage spike.
inductive reactance. An opposition to the flow of alternating current or changing
direct current, caused by inductance in the circuit. Inductive reactance, whose
abbreviation is XL, is measured in ohms, and it decreases the amount of current
flowing in a circuit. Resistance is also measured in ohms, and it too decreases
the current, but resistance uses power and produces heat, while inductive
reactance does not.
Inductive reactance is caused by the generation of an induced voltage whose
polarity is opposite to that of the voltage causing it. The induced voltage opposes
some of the applied voltage, and because there is less voltage available to force
current through the circuit, less current flows. Inductive reactance increases as
both the frequency of the alternating current and the inductance of the circuit
increase. The formula for inductive reactance is:
XL = 2 π fL
XL = Inductive reactance in ohms
2 π = A constant, 6.28
f = Frequency in hertz
L = Circuit inductance in henries
inductive time constant. The amount of time, in seconds, needed for current
flowing in an inductive circuit to reach 63.2% of its maximum value. The
inductive time constant, in seconds, may be found by dividing the circuit
inductance, in henries, by the circuit resistance, in ohms:
TC = L / R
TC = Time constant in seconds
L = Inductance in henries
R = Resistance in ohms

inductive tuning. A method of selecting the frequency to which a radiofrequency circuit is resonant by changing the inductance in a tuned circuit. The
resonant frequency of an L-C circuit (a circuit that contains both inductance and
capacitance) can be changed by changing the amount of either the inductance or
the capacitance. The inductance is normally changed by moving a powdered iron
slug into or out of the coil. Moving the slug into the coil increases the
inductance, and pulling the slug out of the coil decreases the inductance.
inductor. A coil of wire used to produce inductance in an electrical circuit. The
amount of inductance is determined by the number of turns of wire in the coil,
by the ratio of the diameter of the coil to its length, and by the type of material
used as the core of the coil. Inductance is measured in henries, millihenries, or
microhenries.

industrial diamond. A diamond that is not of gem quality, but because of its
hardness, is used as an industrial cutting tool.

inert-gas shielded-arc welding. A form of electric arc welding in which the arc is
formed inside a shield of inert gas, such as argon or helium. The inert gas drives
all the oxygen away from the arc and prevents oxides from forming in the
molten metal.
inert gas. A gas that has a stable atomic structure. Its valence shell neither tries
to gain nor lose electrons. An inert gas has no tendency to unite with other
elements to form chemical compounds. Helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon,
and radon are inert gases.
inertia. A characteristic of all matter that causes an object to try to remain in its
present condition. If the object is at rest, not moving, its inertia tries to keep it at
rest. But if it is moving, its inertia tries to keep it moving—in the same direction,
and at the same speed.
inertial measurement unit (IMU). The main component of inertial navigation
systems used in aircraft, spacecraft, watercraft, drones, UAV/UAS, and guided
missiles, among others. Composed of accelerometers, gyroscopes, and
sometimes magnetometers, an IMU can detect an object’s rate of acceleration
and its rotation in three axes (pitch, roll, and yaw). Used by some sUAS for
stability enhancement, navigation, and control.
inertial navigation system (navigation system). A computer-based navigation
system that tracks the movement of an aircraft by signals produced by onboard
accelerometers. The initial location of the aircraft is entered into the computer,
and all movement of the aircraft is sensed and used to keep the position updated.
An INS does not require any inputs from outside signals. See INS.
inertia starter (reciprocating engine starter). A type of starter used on some large
reciprocating engines. Energy is stored in a spinning flywheel by an electric
motor or a hand crank. When enough energy has been put into the flywheel, it is
coupled to the crankshaft, and turns it fast enough for the engine to start.
inertia switch. An electrical switch actuated by a sudden change in the velocity
of the object on which it is mounted. An inertia switch is built into an emergency
locator transmitter (ELT) installed in an aircraft. If the aircraft crashes, the
inertia switch automatically closes and starts the ELT transmitting.
inflammable. Easily ignited. Because the prefix “in” quite often means “not able
to,” the word inflammable could be thought to mean “is not easy to ignite.”

Because of this possibility for misunderstanding, the word inflammable has been
replaced in many instances with the word “flammable.”
in-flight. Occurring, carried out, or present during flight (e.g., in-flight icing).
in-flight shutdown (IFSD) (ETOPS usage only). Describes when an engine
ceases to function (when the airplane is airborne) and is shut down, whether selfinduced, initiated by the flight crew, or caused by an external influence. The
FAA keeps track of IFSDs for all causes in order to log the number and types of
failure in ETOPS flight; including flameout, internal failure, flight crew-initiated
shutdown, foreign object ingestion, icing, inability to obtain or control desired
thrust or power, and cycling of the start control, however briefly, even if the
engine operates normally for the remainder of the flight.
inflight weather advisory. See weather advisory.
information request. A request originated by an FSS for information concerning
an overdue VFR aircraft.
infrared guidance. A method of guidance used on some missiles that causes the
missile to seek and home on a source of infrared radiation.

than that used to produce ordinary white light. The light produced by an infrared
lamp has a large portion of its electromagnetic energy in the infrared range.
infrared radiation. Invisible electromagnetic radiation whose wavelength is
between 7,800 and 1,000,000 angstroms, just slightly longer than the longest
wavelength of visible light. Infrared radiation is used for heating.
infrasonic frequencies. Frequencies of vibration lower than those in the audible
range. Infrasonic frequencies were formerly called subsonic frequencies.
ingest. To take something in. A gas turbine engine, for example, ingests a large
volume of air in its normal operation.

Ingots are further processed into sheets, bars, tubes, or structural beams.
in-ground effect (IGE) hover (rotorcraft). See hovering in ground effect
(helicopter operation).

inhibitive film (corrosion protection). A hard, airtight oxide coating deposited on
the surface of aluminum or magnesium alloys. Both aluminum and magnesium
alloys corrode easily when their surfaces are covered with an electrolyte such as
water or moist air. To protect against corrosion, an inhibitive oxide film is
deposited on the surface to keep all oxygen and moisture away from the metal.
Inhibitive films may be deposited by either chemical or electrolytic action.
initial approach fix. See IAF.
initial approach segment (ICAO). That segment of an instrument approach
procedure between the initial approach fix and the intermediate approach fix or,
where applicable, the final approach fix or point.
initial climb. The stage of a climb that begins when the airplane leaves the
ground and a pitch attitude has been established to climb away from the takeoff
area.
initial climb area (ICA). An area beginning at the departure end of runway
(DER) to provide unrestricted climb to at least 400 feet above DER elevation.
initialization (computer operation). The process by which a computer is prepared
to run a program. All the addresses, counters, and switches are set to their proper
position for starting.
injection molding. A method of forming both thermoplastic and thermosetting
resins. Soft resin is injected under pressure, into the cavity of a mold and
allowed to cure. The mold is then opened to remove the part.
injection pump (compression-ignition engine component). A high-pressure fuel
pump used on a compression-ignition reciprocating engine. The injection pump
forces a measured amount of fuel as an atomized spray into the combustion
chamber of the engine. The high-pressure, high-temperature air in the cylinder
ignites the atomized fuel as it leaves the injector nozzle.
inland navigation facility. A navigation aid on a North American Route at which
the common route and/or the noncommon route begins or ends.
inlet duct (turbine engine powered aircraft component). The portion of the
aircraft ahead of the engine compressor that takes the air into the aircraft and
directs it into the engine at the correct speed and direction.

inlet guide vanes (gas turbine engine component). Stationary vanes located in
front of the first stage of the compressor in an aircraft gas turbine engine. The
purpose of the inlet guide vanes is to direct the air into the first stage of the
compressor at the proper angle for the most efficient compression. Most inlet
guide vanes are fixed, but in some engines, their angle can be changed by
hydraulic actuators controlled by the fuel control unit. Movable guide vanes
direct the air into the compressor at the correct angle as the operating conditions
inside the engine change.
inlet spike (supersonic aircraft inlet air duct). A sharp-pointed spike in the inlet
air duct of a supersonic aircraft. This spike forms an oblique, or angled, shock
wave inside the inlet duct as it passes through the air. Air entering the first-stage
compressor of a gas turbine engine must flow at a speed below the speed of
sound, and when the airplane is flying faster than sound, the air must be slowed
before it enters the compressor.
When air passes through the oblique shock wave, it slows down, but is still
moving faster than the speed of sound. Just inside the inlet duct, a second shock
wave, this time a normal shock wave, is produced. This normal shock wave is at
right angles to the airflow, and air passing through it is slowed to a speed below
the speed of sound.
in-line engine (reciprocating engine). A reciprocating engine in which all the
cylinders are arranged in a straight line. In an in-line engine, the piston in each
cylinder is connected to a separate throw of the crankshaft.
V-engines are a form of inline engine having two banks of cylinders mounted
on the crankcase, with an angle of between 45 and 90 degrees between the
banks. Two pistons, one in a cylinder in each bank, connect to each throw of the
crankshaft.
inner marker (instrument landing system component). A marker beacon used
with an ILS Category II precision approach. It is located between the middle
marker and the end of the ILS runway.
Inner markers transmit a radiation pattern keyed with six dots per second and
indicate both aurally and visually that, if the aircraft is on the glide path, it is at
the designated decision height (DH)—normally 100 feet above the touchdown
zone elevation on the CAT II approach.
inner tube. An airtight rubber tube used inside a pneumatic tire to hold the air
that inflates the tire. Some tires do not use inner tubes, because the tire itself

forms an airtight seal with the wheel.
inoperative. Not functioning, or not working. A device or circuit is inoperative
when it is not working or not able to be used.
inoperative components. Higher minimums are prescribed when the specified
visual aids are not functioning; this information is listed in the Inoperative
Components Table found in the U.S. Terminal Procedures Publications.
in phase. A condition in which two vibrations or changing electrical signals pass
through zero at the same time, going in the same direction. To be in phase, both
signals or vibrations should reach their positive and negative peak values at the
same time.
input capacitance. The capacitance across the input terminals of an electrical
circuit. It is the capacitance “seen” by the input device.
input circuit (electronic equipment). The circuit through which the input signal
or input information is introduced into a piece of electronic equipment. The
input circuit of an amplifier, for example, must supply whatever power is needed
by a microphone, and it must have an input impedance that matches the
impedance of the microphone.
input impedance. The impedance across the input terminals of an electronic
circuit or device. The input impedance must be matched with the impedance of
the component that provides the input signal.
input transformer. An electrical transformer used to feed an alternating current
signal from a pickup device into the input stage of an electronic system. The
input transformer isolates the pickup device from the input circuit and matches
the impedance of the two devices. See impedance matching.
inrush current (electrical machines). The large amount of current that flows into
an electrical machine when the switch is first closed. When an electric motor is
connected to a power source, a high rate of current begins to flow. This inrush
current causes the rotor to begin to turn, and as it turns, it produces a back
voltage, or counter EMF, that opposes the source voltage. Since the CEMF
opposes the source voltage, the net voltage (the voltage that actually forces the
current through the motor) drops, and the current flowing into the motor
decreases to a value much lower than the inrush current.

Incandescent light bulbs also cause a high inrush current. The resistance of the
light bulb filaments is low when they are cold, but as soon as current flows
through them, they get hot, and their resistance increases. The current drops
below that of the inrush current as the filament resistance increases.
INS (inertial navigation system). A form of computerized long-range navigation
system that is entirely independent of outside signals. The exact latitude and
longitude of the aircraft is entered into the computer before takeoff, and
accelerometers and gyros produce input signals that continually update the
computer as the aircraft moves through the air.
The latitude and longitude of the destination and of way points along the route
are entered into the computer, and the INS works with the course deviation
indicator (CDI) and the horizontal situation indicator (HSI) to direct the
autopilot or the human pilot to fly the correct course to the chosen waypoint or
destination.
inside calipers (measuring device). A hinged measuring device similar to a pair
of dividers. The difference between inside calipers and dividers is that the ends
of the caliper’s legs are bent outward so they are at right angles to the legs.
Inside calipers are used to measure the inside diameter of a hole. The legs of the
calipers are placed in the hole and spread until the points just touch the outside
edges. The calipers are then taken from the hole and the distance between the
points measured with a steel scale.

inside micrometer. A precision measuring instrument used to measure the inside
diameter of a cylinder or hole in increments of a thousandth of an inch or less.

The body of an inside micrometer is the same as that used on an outside
micrometer caliper. The ends of the thimble and the spindle are rounded, and
when the zero mark on the thimble is lined up with the zero index on the sleeve,
the end of the spindle and the end of the thimble are exactly two inches apart,
and the spindle will move out of the thimble for exactly one inch. Extensions can
be fastened into the end of the spindle to measure diameters greater than three
inches.
insight (in learning process). The mental relating and grouping of associated
perceptions into meaningful wholes. Creating insight in students is one of an
instructor’s major responsibilities, so they can understand how each factor or
change of factors in a process can affect all the others.
insolation (meteorology). Incoming solar radiation falling upon the earth and its
atmosphere.
Inspection Authorization. See IA.
inspection door (aircraft component). A small hinged cover installed over an
opening in an aircraft structure. These openings allow the inspection of the
inside of the aircraft.
inspection plate (aircraft component). A plate or panel used to cover an
inspection opening in an aircraft structure. Inspection plates in nonstressed
portions of the structure may be held in place with a few machine screws or selftapping sheet-metal screws, but inspection plates in a highly-stressed portion of
the structure are held in place with a large number of high-strength structural
screws.
instability (meteorology). A general term used to indicate various states of the
atmosphere in which spontaneous convection will occur when prescribed criteria
are met. Instability of the air indicates turbulence.
installation drawing (aircraft drawing). A drawing used to show the way
subassemblies are put together to make a complete assembly. A bill of materials
included with an installation drawing gives the name and part number of all the
components used to connect the subassemblies. Dimensions are not normally
given on an assembly drawing, but where dimensions are needed, they are
shown on the detail drawings for the parts listed in the installation drawing.

installation error (static air system error). An error in any of the instruments
connected to the aircraft static air system, caused by the static air source not
being located in an area in which the air is absolutely still (static). Installation
error affects the airspeed indicator, altimeter, and vertical speed indicator, and it
changes as the angle of attack of the aircraft changes.
instantaneous impact point. 14 CFR §401.5: “An impact point, following thrust
termination of a launch vehicle, calculated in the absence of atmospheric drag
effects.”
instantaneous rate of climb indicator (aircraft flight instrument). A type of
vertical speed indicator that compensates for the lag inherent in these
instruments. When the aircraft pitches at the beginning of a climb or descent,
two accelerometer-actuated air pumps inside the instrument case send a change
of air pressure into the indicating bellows to start the pointer moving in the
correct direction. As soon as the aircraft actually begins changing altitude, the
change in static air pressure actuates the instrument mechanism.
instantaneous vertical speed indicator (IVSI). A flight instrument that assists in
interpretation by instantaneously indicating the rate of climb or descent at a
given moment with little or no lag, as is experienced with a vertical speed
indicator (VSI).
instructional aids. Devices that assist an instructor in the teaching-learning
process. They are supplementary training devices, and are not stand-alone or
self-supporting.
Instructions for Continued Airworthiness (maintenance manual). A manual
published by an aircraft manufacturer specifying procedures for inspection,
maintenance, repair, and mandatory replacement times for life-limited parts.
instrument. 14 CFR Part 1: “A device using an internal mechanism to show
visually or aurally the attitude, altitude, or operation of an aircraft or aircraft
part. It includes electronic devices for automatically controlling an aircraft in
flight.”
instrument approach procedure (air traffic control). A series of predetermined
maneuvers for the orderly transfer of an aircraft under instrument flight
conditions from the beginning of the initial approach to a landing or to a point
from which a landing may be made visually. An instrument approach procedure
is prescribed and approved for a specific airport by competent authority.

instrument approach procedure (ICAO). A series of predetermined maneuvers by
reference to flight instruments with specified protection from obstacles from the
initial approach fix, or where applicable, from the beginning of a defined arrival
route to a point from which a landing can be completed and thereafter, if a
landing is not completed, to a position at which holding or en route obstacle
clearance criteria apply.
Instrument Approach Procedures Charts. Aeronautical charts that portray the
aeronautical data required to execute an instrument approach to an airport. These
charts depict the procedures, including all related data, and the airport diagram.
Each procedure is designated for use with a specific type of electronic navigation
system, such as NDB, TACAN, VOR, ILS, and RNAV.
instrument approach waypoint. Fixes used in defining RNAV instrument
approach procedures, including the feeder waypoint (FWP), the initial approach
waypoint (IAWP), the intermediate waypoint (IWP), the final approach
waypoint (FAWP), the runway waypoint (RWY WP), and the airport waypoint
(APT WP), when required.
instrument clamp. A cylindrical metal clamp attached to the back of an
instrument panel aligned with the hole through which an instrument fits. The
instrument is installed from the front of the panel by sliding it through the hole
and the clamp and tightening the clamp by means of a screw on the front of the
panel.

The indication on the millivoltmeter is directly related to the amount of current
flowing through the shunt, and because of this, it is possible to calibrate the dial
of the millivoltmeter directly in amps or milliamps.

overheating the structure through which they are routed.
insulation blanket (turbine engine aircraft component). A layer of fireproof
insulating material used to keep heat from the tail pipe of a gas turbine engine
from damaging the aircraft structure. Insulation blankets are usually quilted, to

the vacuum is the dielectric. High-frequency signals can feed back from one
electrode to another through the interelectrode capacitance inside a tube. To
prevent this feedback, neutralizing circuits must be used.

hot and the other is cold, but when they reach the same temperature, the fit is so
tight they will not loosen in service.

corrosion are types of intergranular corrosion.
inter-integrated circuit (I2C). A bi-directional two-wire serial bus that provides a

interlock. A form of automatic safety control. An interlock in a device can
prevent an action from occurring until the device is ready for the action. An
interlock can be installed on the door of a compartment so the door cannot be
opened when the equipment inside the compartment is operating. When the door
is opened, the interlock switch automatically turns the power off and discharges
any high-voltage capacitors inside the housing.

when approaching the airport from certain directions, and as an IFWP when
beginning the approach from another IAWP.
intermediate frequency (radio receiver). A single frequency of alternating current
produced inside a superheterodyne radio receiver. A superheterodyne receiver
circuit is efficient because most of its amplification is done with a single
intermediate frequency, rather than with a wide band of frequencies.
A local oscillator inside the receiver produces an alternating current whose
frequency is always a constant amount different from the radio-frequency signal
being received. When the local oscillator signal is mixed with the received
signal, two other frequencies are produced: One frequency is the sum of the two,
and the other is the difference between the two. Filters allow only the signal
whose frequency is the difference between the two to be amplified. This is the
intermediate frequency, the IF.
intermediate frequency transformer (radio receiver component). An interstage
coupling transformer used in a superheterodyne radio receiver. Both the primary
and secondary windings of the IF transformer are tuned to the intermediate
frequency. See intermediate frequency. The output winding of the IF transformer
feeds the input of the IF amplifier with a signal whose frequency is that to which
the IF transformer is tuned.
intermediate landing. On the rare occasion that this option is requested, it should
be approved. The departure center, however, must advise the ATCSCC so that
the appropriate delay is carried over and assigned at the intermediate airport. An
intermediate landing airport within the arrival center will not be accepted
without coordination with and the approval of the ATCSCC.
intermittent-duty relay or solenoid. An electrically operated relay or solenoid
that must be de-energized (the power to its operating coil must be turned off) at

with a flat top and a hexagonal socket cut into it. Internally wrenching bolts are
used for high-strength and high-temperature applications.
internal resistance (batteries). Opposition to the flow of current caused by the
plates of a battery. The internal resistance of a lead-acid storage battery increases
as the battery becomes discharged, and current flowing through the higher

centrifugal air pump installed inside a reciprocating engine. Fuel and air are
mixed in the carburetor, and the mixture is compressed by the internal
supercharger before it is distributed to the cylinders.

biplane, usually near the wing tips. Interplane struts attach to the front and rear
wing spars and are normally N-shaped or I-shaped.
interpolate. To determine a value in a series between two known values.
interpole (electrical machine component). A field pole in a compound-wound
generator used to minimize armature reaction. Armature reaction is the distortion
of the magnetic field produced by the field coils caused by the magnetic field
produced by current flowing in the armature. The amount of armature reaction
varies with the armature current. Armature reaction causes a voltage across the
commutator segments shorted by the brushes, and this produces sparks.
Interpoles are located between each of the regular field poles, and the interpole
coils are in series with the armature so all the armature current flows through
them. The magnetic fields produced by the interpole coils cancel the distortion
caused by the armature field, and the brushes short across segments of the
commutator where there is no potential difference and therefore no sparking.
inter-rib bracing (fabric-covered wing component). Bracing between the ribs of a
fabric-covered wing made of reinforcing tape wrapped around the rib cap strips
midway between the spars. Inter-rib bracing holds the ribs in the correct position
until they are laced to the fabric.

and the intensity of sound pressure. When referring to the strength of a magnetic
field, the inverse square law states that the strength of the field varies inversely
(the strength decreases as the distance increases) as the square of the distance
between the pole and the point at which the strength is measured. For example, if
we double the distance (make it two times as great), the magnetic strength is
decreased to a value of one-fourth its original strength. One-fourth is the inverse

An isolation transformer electrically isolates equipment connected to its
secondary winding from the power line. This isolation prevents the danger of
electrical shock when working on the equipment.

the aircraft structure when a difficult takeoff is to be made. The JATO units are
fired the moment the aircraft rotates for takeoff, and the boost from the rocket
engines provides the additional thrust needed to get the aircraft airborne. JATO
is more properly called RATO for Rocket Assisted TakeOff.

pressure by moving fluid at a high velocity through a venturi. A jet pump can be
used to remove vapor from fuel before it enters a fuel control unit. Some of the
fuel from the main fuel pump is returned to the tank through a venturi (the jet
pump). The venturi is connected to the top of the chamber in which the vapors
collect. The low pressure at the throat of the venturi pulls the vapors out of the
chamber and returns them with the fuel back to the tank.

jet pump (environmental control system). A special venturi in a line carrying air
from certain areas in an aircraft that need an augmented flow of air through
them. High-velocity compressor bleed air is blown into the throat of a venturi
where it produces a low pressure that pulls air from the area to which it is
connected. Jet pumps are often used in the lines that pull air through galleys and
toilet areas.

rouge is used for polishing hard metal surfaces.
JFET (junction field effect transistor). A high-impedance semiconductor device
that controls the flow of electrons between its source and drain by a voltage
placed on its gate. The function of a JFET is similar to that of a bipolar
transistor, except the control is a small change in voltage rather than a small
change in current.

jig (manufacturing fixture). A strong, heavy framework used to hold a
component while it is being assembled. Parts are assembled in jigs to assure their
interchangeability. Airplane wings, for example, are assembled in jigs, and any
wing having a given part number can be interchanged with another wing having
the same part number.

If the parts were not assembled in a jig, they might look the same, but they
would probably not interchange; the bolt holes would likely not line up.

a newton-meter. One joule is equal to 0.1020 meter-kilogram, or 0.7375 footpound of work.
journal (bearing surface). A hardened and polished surface on a rotating shaft
that rides in a plain bearing. The bearing journal provides a smooth bearing
surface and wears very little.
joystick (airplane control). An old name for the control stick used to control an
airplane. Movement of the joystick to the front or back moves the elevators to
control the pitch of the airplane. Movement from side to side moves the ailerons
to rotate the airplane about its longitudinal axis (to roll the airplane).
The term joystick has been changed to control stick or, more simply, to just
“stick.”

flash point of 60°C, and a freezing point of −46°C. It was developed for the U.S.
Navy for use in aircraft operated from aircraft carriers where the risk from fire is
particularly great. JP-5 is similar to the newer JP-8.
JP-7 (gas turbine engine fuel). JP-7 is a jet fuel developed by the U.S. Air Force
for use in supersonic aircraft because of its high flashpoint and thermal stability.
It is the fuel used in the Pratt and Whitney J58 engines, installed in the Lockheed
SR-71 Blackbird. JP-7 is a mixture composed of hydrocarbons, and it includes
additives to increase its lubricating properties, an oxidizing agent to make it burn
better, and it contains a compound which aids in disguising the radar signature of
the exhaust. JP-7 has low vapor pressure and high thermal oxidation stability and
is to operate over a wide range of temperatures, from near freezing of high

altitudes to the high temperature of airframe and engine parts with which it
comes in contact.
JP-8 (gas turbine engine fuel). JP-8 is a kerosine-based jet fuel, adopted in by the
U.S. government as a replacement for JP-4 because it is less flammable and less
hazardous. It contains icing and corrosion inhibitors, lubricants, and antistatic
agents, and has better safety and combat survivability. JP-8 is the equivalent of
commercial Jet-A.

used as the emitter and collector. Between the two layers of N material is a very
thin layer of P-material, which acts as the base. Electrons flowing between the
emitter and base control the electrons flowing between the emitter and collector.
A PNP junction transistor is like an NPN transistor except that the base is made
of N-material between an emitter and collector of P-material. See illustration for
bipolar transistor.

keel (seaplane structure). The main longitudinal structural member extending
along the center line of the bottom of a seaplane hull or float.
keeper (magnet). A piece of soft iron placed across the poles of a magnet when
the magnet is not being used. Magnetic energy is used to force lines of flux
through the air between the poles, and the loss of this energy partially
demagnetizes the magnet.
The amount of energy used is determined by the reluctance (the opposition to
the passage of the lines of flux) of the material between the poles. The soft iron
keeper has a very low reluctance compared with air, and when the lines of flux
travel through the keeper rather than through the air, less energy is used, and the
magnet self-demagnetizes less.
Kelvin bridge (resistance measuring instrument). A form of precision resistancemeasuring instrument which is a modification of the Wheatstone bridge. A

Kelvin bridge minimizes the effect of lead and contact resistance and is used for
accurate measurements of low resistances.

zero on a scale using the same divisions as are used in the Celsius system. Water
freezes at 273°K and boils at 373°K.
Kennelly-Heaviside layer (atmospheric layer). A layer of ionized particles in the
atmosphere at an altitude of between 100 and 120 kilometers above the surface
of the earth. Some radio waves cannot penetrate these particles, and they bounce
back to the earth. The Kennelly-Heaviside layer is also called the Heaviside
layer and the E-layer.
kerf. The slit (the narrow slot, or opening) made by a saw blade as it cuts
through wood, metal, or plastic, or by a cutting torch as it cuts through metal.
kerosine (petroleum product). A light (specific gravity of about 0.8), almost
colorless hydrocarbon liquid obtained from crude oil by the process of fractional
distillation. Kerosine is used as a fuel for lamps and stoves and as a base for
turbine engine fuel, and is commonly called coal oil.
The name kerosine was originally spelled kerosene, but the “ene” ending
wrongly implied that kerosine is made of unsaturated compounds (compounds
having atoms bound together with more than one bond). To keep the spelling of
the name from giving the wrong idea of the chemical composition of the
material, the spelling was changed in 1957 by petroleum chemists to kerosine.

into the side of the hole in the hub that fits on the shaft is aligned with the
keyway on the shaft, and a rectangular piece of metal called a key locks the
keyways together, preventing the hub turning on the shaft.

90°, the value of K is greater than 1.
kHz. The abbreviation for kilohertz (1,000 cycles per second).
KIAS. Knots indicated airspeed.
kickback (reciprocating engine operation). A condition of engine operation in
which the engine tries to run backward when it is being started. Kickback is
caused by the ignition spark occurring while the piston is moving slowly upward
on the compression stroke. Since the piston is moving slowly, the pressure from
the expanding gases is applied to the piston before it passes over top center of
the compression stroke. Kickback is prevented by timing the ignition so the
starting spark occurs late.
kick-in pressure (hydraulic system operation). The pressure at which an
unloading valve causes a hydraulic pump to direct its fluid into the system
manifold.

kick-out pressure (hydraulic system operation). The pressure at which an
unloading valve shuts off the flow of fluid into the system pressure manifold and

equal to the sum of the current flowing to that point.
Kirchhoff’s voltage law. One of the basic laws of electrical circuits stating that
the algebraic sum of all of the voltage drops in any closed circuit is equal to
zero. Another way to think of this is that the sum of all the voltage drops in a
circuit is equal to the sum of the voltage sources in the circuit.

balancing instruments.
knife switch (electrical component). A type of electrical switch having a
movable blade (the knife) for one of the terminals and two contacts that are
spring-loaded together for the other terminal. When the blade is between the
contacts, the switch is closed, and current flows in the circuit. When the blade is
lifted from the contacts, the switch is open, and no current flows. Knife switches
are seldom used in aircraft electrical circuits.
knock (reciprocating engine operation). A loud rattling noise inside the cylinders
of a reciprocating engine caused by shock waves produced by detonating fuel.

The fuel-air mixture burning inside a cylinder is supposed to move across the
face of the piston with a smooth flame front. But if the wrong type or wrong
amount of fuel is used, the fuel-air mixture ahead of the flame front gets so hot it
explodes. The explosion, called detonation, causes shock waves and produces a
tremendous amount of pressure in the cylinder. The resultant stresses can
damage the engine.

The pistons in the other cylinders are connected to the master rod by link rods
(articulated rods), and the link rods are connected to the master rod with knuckle
pins.

wings of some high-performance airplanes. When a Krueger flap is retracted into
the wing, the leading edge has the shape that allows efficient high-speed flight.
When the airplane is prepared for landing or takeoff, the Krueger flaps are
extended, and they deflect the airflow into the trailing-edge flaps. The
combination of leading-edge and trailing-edge flaps allows the airplane wing to
develop its needed lift at the lowest possible airspeed.
krypton. A colorless, odorless, tasteless, inert, gaseous chemical element.
Krypton’s symbol is Kr, its atomic number is 36, and its atomic weight is 83.80.

that alerts the controller when a Mode C transponder-equipped aircraft on an IFR
flight plan is below a predetermined minimum safe altitude.
labyrinth seal. A type of air and/or oil seal used around the main-shaft bearings
in a gas turbine engine. The seal consists of a series of rotating blades that
almost contact the seal land. A small amount of air flows between the seal and
the land and prevents oil flowing past the seal.

a difficulty which arises because words have different meanings for the source
and the receiver of information due to their differing backgrounds.
lacquer (finishing material). A material used to decorate and protect a surface.
Lacquer is made of a film base, solvents, plasticizers, and thinners. The film
base forms a tough film over the surface when it dries. The solvents dissolve the
film base so it can be applied as a liquid. The plasticizers give the film base the
needed resilience, and the thinners dilute the lacquer so it can be applied with a
spray gun.
Lacquer is sprayed on the surface as a liquid, and as soon as the solvents and
the thinner evaporate, the film base remains as a tough, decorative coating.

same as 1/π (0.3183) candela per square centimeter.
laminar flow (aerodynamics). A type of airflow over an airfoil in which the air
passes over the surface in smooth layers with a minimum of turbulence. With
most airfoils, there is a layer of air adjacent to the surface that flows in a random
fashion, even sometimes reversing its direction of flow. This is called the
boundary layer.
A laminar-flow airfoil is designed in such a way that the boundary layer has a
minimum thickness, and nearly all the air flows in smooth layers. Laminar flow
of the air decreases the drag produced by the airfoil.
laminated core (electrical machinery). The core of an electrical transformer made
up of a stack of thin sheets, or laminations, of soft iron or a special highly
permeable steel, insulated from each other by an oxide or varnish coating.
Eddy currents are induced into the cores of transformers by alternating current
flowing in the windings surrounding them, and these eddy currents produce heat
and cause electrical losses. The high resistance of the laminated core opposes the
flow of eddy current and minimizes the losses.
laminated plastic material. A type of reinforced plastic resin made by laminating,
or stacking together, layers of cloth, paper, or wood that are impregnated with
plastic resin. The layers of the material are forced together by pressure, and the
resin is cured with heat.

communications indicating that the landing site and duration of flight are at the
discretion of the pilot. Extended flight beyond the nearest approved landing area
is not recommended.
land breeze (meteorology). A coastal breeze blowing from land to sea. Land
breezes, which normally blow at night, are caused by a temperature difference
when the sea surface is warmer than the adjacent land. Land breezes alternate
with sea breezes, which blow inland during the day when the sea surface
temperature is cooler than the land.
lander (space vehicle). A space vehicle designed to land on a celestial body, such
as the moon or one of the planets.
“land immediately” (air traffic control). A phrase used in ATC–pilot
communications that means the urgency of the landing is paramount. The
primary consideration is to ensure the survival of the occupants. Landing in
trees, water, or other unsafe areas should be considered only as a last resort.

landing area (air traffic control). Any locality either on land, water, or structures,
including airports/heliports and intermediate landing fields, which is used, or
intended to be used, for the landing and takeoff of aircraft. Landing areas may or
may not have facilities for the shelter and servicing of aircraft, or for receiving
or discharging passengers or cargo.

landing distance available (ICAO). The length of runway which is declared
available and suitable for the ground run of an aeroplane landing.
landing flaps (airplane secondary control surfaces). An airplane control surface
used to increase the camber, or curvature, of the wing airfoil. This increases both
the lift and the drag produced by the wing.
By increasing the lift, the airplane can be landed at a slower airspeed, and by
increasing the drag, the airplane can descend at a steeper angle without building
up excessive airspeed. Some landing flaps increase the area of the wing as well
as the camber. See plain flap, split flap, slotted flap, Fowler flap, and tripleslotted flap.
landing gear (aircraft component). The part of an aircraft structure that supports
the aircraft when it is not flying. For operation from runways and dry ground, the
landing gear uses wheels. Operation from snow and ice is done with skis, and
operation from water is done with a landing gear using floats.
Wheeled landing gear is by far the most common, and there are two basic
types: tricycle and tail wheel-type. The tail wheel-type landing gear is often
called a conventional landing gear. In a tricycle landing gear, two main wheels
are located behind the center of gravity, and a third wheel, nearly as large as the
main wheels, is located near the nose of the aircraft. In a tail wheel-type landing
gear, the two main wheels are ahead of the center of gravity, and a much smaller
wheel is located at the tail of the aircraft.
Landing gear can be either fixed so it is always extended in the airstream or
retractable. Retractable landing gear can be folded into the wing or fuselage
when the aircraft is off the ground, reducing the drag caused by air flowing over
the structure.
landing gear extended speed. 14 CFR Part 1: “The maximum speed at which an
aircraft can be safely flown with the landing gear extended.”

landing gear operating speed. 14 CFR Part 1: “The maximum speed at which
the landing gear can be safely extended or retracted.”
landing gear position indicating system. A system required on all aircraft having
retractable landing gear to show the pilot the position of the landing gear. The
most commonly used system on modern aircraft is a series of lights. When all
three wheels are down and locked, three green lights appear on the instrument
panel. A red light indicates that the landing gear is in transit. It has been released
by the up-locks, but it has not yet locked down.
landing gear warning system. A warning system used in an aircraft with
retractable landing gear, to warn the pilot of an unsafe landing gear condition. A
red light indicates that any of the wheels are in an unsafe condition, and an aural
warning system sounds a horn if any of the wheels are not down and locked
when the throttles are retarded for landing.
landing light (aircraft component). A high-intensity spotlight mounted on an
aircraft and aimed in such a direction that it shines on the runway when the
aircraft is on the final approach for landing.
landing minimums, IFR (aircraft operation). The minimum visibility prescribed
for landing a civil aircraft while using an instrument approach procedure. The
minimums apply with other limitations set forth in 14 CFR Part 91 with respect
to the minimum descent altitude (MDA) or decision height (DH) prescribed in
the instrument approach procedures.
landing roll. The distance from the point of touchdown to the point where the
aircraft can be brought to a stop or can exit the runway.
landing sequence. The order in which aircraft are positioned for landing.
landing/takeoff area. Any locality, either on land, water, or structures, including
airports/heliports and intermediate landing fields, which is used, or intended to
be used, for the landing and takeoff of aircraft. A landing/takeoff area is not
required to have facilities for shelter, servicing, and receiving or discharging
passengers or cargo.
landing weight (aircraft specification). The maximum weight an aircraft is
allowed to have for landing. Landings put far more stress into an aircraft
structure than takeoffs, and therefore large aircraft that fly for long distances are
allowed to have a greater weight for takeoff than for landing.

Airplanes approved for a greater takeoff weight than landing weight must have
some method of jettisoning enough fuel to bring the weight down to the
allowable landing weight if the aircraft should have to land before enough fuel
has been consumed by the engines.
landing wires (airplane structural components). Brace wires used to support the
weight of the wings during landing and when they are not producing lift. The
landing wires of a biplane run from the center section of the upper wing to the
interplane strut on the lower wing.
landplane. An airplane with a wheeled landing gear that enables it to operate
from a hard surface, rather than from water or snow.
lanthanum. A soft, silvery-white, malleable, ductile, metallic, rare-earth
chemical element. Lanthanum’s symbol is La, its atomic number is 57, and its
atomic weight is 138.91. Lanthanum is used as an element in making glass for
special lights.
lap belt. A name sometimes given to a seat belt or safety belt used to hold a
person seated in an aircraft. A lap belt passes across a person’s lap.
lap joint. A type of joint made between two pieces of material in which one
piece is lapped over the other and the two fastened together. Lap joints are used
to join sheets of metal by welding, riveting, or bolting. Lap joints are also used
for joining sheets of wood, paper, or cloth with adhesives.

lapping (machining operation). A method of producing a close fit between two
metal parts by rubbing them together with a very fine abrasive lapping
compound between them. The fit of a lapped joint is checked by removing all
the lapping compound and lightly coating one of the surfaces with Prussian blue
transfer dye. The parts are reassembled and rubbed together. If the parts fit as
they should, the Prussian blue will transfer evenly to the part that was not
covered. If not enough blue transfers, more lapping is required.
lapping compound. A very fine abrasive paste used to wear away a metal surface
to make it smooth, and to assure a perfect fit between two machined surfaces.

Lapping compound is similar to valve-grinding compound.
laps (metal defects). A type of metal defect produced in the rolling mill. Ridges
or bulges on the surface of the metal are folded over and forced down into the
metal as it is being rolled. Laps decrease the strength of the metal.
lapse rate (meteorology). The rate of decrease of an atmospheric variable with
height. Lapse rates often refer to a decrease in temperature with height.
lap winding (electrical armature). A method of connecting the armature coils in a
DC generator or motor. The ends of each coil on the armature are connected to
the next adjacent commutator segment, and the coils lap over each other. Lap
winding differs from wave winding in which the ends of the coils are attached to
segments on the opposite side of the commutator.
large aircraft. 14 CFR Part 1: “Aircraft of more than 12,500 pounds, maximum
certificated takeoff weight.”
large calorie (C). A unit of heat energy. One large calorie, also called a
kilocalorie, is the amount of heat energy needed to raise the temperature of one
kilogram of water one degree Celsius. One large calorie is equal to 1,000 small
calories.
large scale integration (LSI) (digital electronics). A method of miniaturization of
electronic circuit components, in which 100 or more gates are built into a single
integrated circuit (IC) chip. LSI techniques lower the cost per gate of logic
components.
LASCR (light-activated silicon controlled rectifier). A semiconductor device
having two P-sections and two N-sections. Light falling on the LASCR produces
gate current that triggers it into a state of conduction.

laser. A coined word meaning Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of
Radiation. A laser changes incoherent light, light whose vibrations do not have
any consistent phase relationship, into coherent light, light whose vibrations are
all in phase.

The light beam from a laser is highly concentrated, very narrow, and has an
extremely high intensity. High-power lasers produce a great deal of heat in an
extremely small area, and laser technology is opening new doors in all aspects of
science.
laser memory (computer memory). A method of storing a large amount of digital
information permanently and inexpensively on a disk similar to but smaller than
a phonograph record. A high-power laser (see laser) burns extremely small pits
into the reflective surface of a disk to write, or record, digital data on the disk.
The information stored on the disk is read by the reflection or the lack of
reflection of a low-power laser shone on the surface. A reflection is read as a
logic one, and a space where there is no reflection, an area caused by a pit, is
read as a logic zero.
The fact that billions of bits can be stored on a relatively small disk makes laser
memory an inexpensive method of storing video programs.
laser printer. A type of printer used to produce a hard copy of the information
being processed by a computer. A laser (see laser) shines a series of dots of light
in a matrix pattern onto the surface of the paper as it moves in front of the print
head, and each dot of light leaves the paper with an electrostatic charge.
A dust of metallic powder, called toner, is blown across the paper, and some of
it sticks to the charged areas. None, however, sticks to the uncharged portion of
the paper. The paper with the powder sticking to the charged areas passes over a
heater, which fuses, or melts, the powder into the paper to form a permanent
image.
laser ring gyro. A device that can replace mechanical gyroscopes in aircraft by
using laser light to detect motion. A laser ring gyro has no moving parts and
consequently has no precession due to friction.
laser tachometer. A highly accurate tachometer that shines a laser beam on the
rotating element and senses the reflection from a reflective tape or contrasting
mark. The reflected laser beam is converted into electrical pulses which are
counted and displayed on a monitoring instrument.
laser welding. A method of welding by the heat produced by a laser beam. The
high-intensity, concentrated heat allows the welding of exotic alloys that cannot
be welded by other methods.

last assigned altitude. The last altitude/flight level assigned by ATC and
acknowledged by the pilot.
last-chance filter (gas turbine engine component). An oil filter installed in the
lubricating system of a gas turbine engine just ahead of the jets that spray oil
onto the bearings. These filters trap any contaminants that get past the main
system filters and prevent the oil jets becoming clogged. Last-chance filters
cannot be serviced during normal engine maintenance. They are cleaned only
when the engine is disassembled for overhaul.
latching relay (locking relay). A relay that, once energized, remains in its
energized condition after the current stops flowing in its coil. When the relay is
energized, the contacts are locked in the energized position by a mechanical
latch. A mechanical release must be actuated to allow the relay to return to its
de-energized condition. Latching relays are being replaced to a great extent by
solid-state flip-flop circuits.
latency (electronic display). The amount of time taken by the display system to
react to a triggered event coming from an input/output device, the symbol
generator, graphic processor, or information source.
latent heat. Heat added to a material which changes its physical state, but does
not change its temperature. When a pan of water is put on a hot stove and heat is
added to it, its temperature rises—but in standard conditions, only until it
reaches 100°C. Heat which changes the temperature of water is called sensible
heat. If additional heat is added to the water, it will boil away, or change from
liquid water into water vapor, but its temperature will not change. Heat added to
water after it begins to boil is called latent heat—more correctly, latent heat of
evaporation, or latent heat of vaporization. When water vapor is cooled until it
condenses into liquid water, the latent heat which caused the evaporation is
given up by the water and absorbed by the surrounding air.
latent heat of condensation. Heat released during the change of state that occurs
when water vapor changes into liquid water.
latent heat of fusion. Heat absorbed during the change of state that occurs when
solid water (ice) changes into liquid water.
latent heat of sublimation. Heat absorbed during the change of state that occurs
when ice changes directly into water vapor without passing through the liquid
state.

latent heat of vaporization. Heat absorbed during the change of state in which
liquid water is changed into water vapor.
lateral axis of an airplane. An imaginary line passing through the center of
gravity of an airplane and extending across the airplane parallel to a line joining
the wing tips. The lateral axis is also called the pitch axis, and movement of the
elevators rotates an airplane about its lateral axis.

lateral balance (aircraft stability). Balance around the longitudinal, or roll, axis
of an aircraft.
lateral navigation (LNAV). A function of area navigation (RNAV) equipment
which calculates, displays, and provides lateral guidance to a profile or path.
lateral offset moment (helicopter operation). The moment, in pound-inches (lbin), of a force that tends to rotate a helicopter about its longitudinal axis. The
lateral offset moment is the product of the weight of the object and its distance
from butt line zero. Lateral offset moments that tend to rotate the aircraft
clockwise are positive, and those that tend to rotate it counterclockwise are
negative.
lateral precision performance with vertical guidance (LPV). A type of approach
with vertical guidance (APV) based on WAAS, published on RNAV (GPS)
approach charts. This procedure takes advantage of the precise lateral guidance
available from WAAS. The minima is published as a decision altitude (DA).
lateral separation (air traffic control). The lateral spacing of aircraft at the same
altitude by requiring operation on different routes or in different geographic
locations.
lateral stability (aircraft stability). The stability of an airplane about its
longitudinal axis, the axis passing through an airplane from nose to tail. If an

airplane is disturbed from level flight so that one wing drops, lateral stability
returns it to a level-flight attitude.
When a wing drops, the airplane begins to slip to that side, and the lift
produced by the lowered wing increases. At the same time, the lift produced by
the raised wing decreases. This uneven lift, caused by lateral stability, returns the
airplane to level flight.

lateral vibration (helicopter operation). Vibration of a helicopter which causes
the rotor to move back and forth in a lateral plane. Lateral vibration is often
caused by an out-of-balance main rotor.
lathe (machine tool). A metalworking or woodworking power tool used to
change the shape or size of cylindrically shaped objects. The material to be
shaped is clamped horizontally in a chuck and is rotated. The unclamped end of
the material is steadied by the lathe tail stock. Cutting tools are fed into the
material from the side to remove unwanted material.
latitude. The angular measurement of distance on the surface of the earth, north
and south of the equator. Latitude is measured in degrees, minutes, and seconds,
and parallels of latitude cut the earth into imaginary parallel slices. The equator,
which is zero degrees latitude, forms a belt around the center of the earth. The
north pole is 90° north latitude, and the south pole is 90° south latitude.
launch. 14 CFR §401.5: “To place or try to place a launch vehicle or reentry
vehicle and any payload from Earth in a suborbital trajectory, in Earth orbit in
outer space, or otherwise in outer space, and includes preparing a launch vehicle
for flight at a launch site in the United States.”

“(1) An event that causes a fatality or serious injury (as defined in 49 CFR
830.2) to any person who is not associated with the flight;
(2) An event that causes damage estimated to exceed $25,000 to property not
associated with the flight that is not located at the launch site or designated

recovery area;
(3) An unplanned event occurring during the flight of a launch vehicle
resulting in the impact of a launch vehicle, its payload or any component
thereof:
(i) For an expendable launch vehicle, outside designated impact limit lines;
and
(ii) For a reusable launch vehicle, outside a designated landing site.
(4) For a launch that takes place with a person on board, a fatality or serious
injury to a space flight participant or crew member.”
launch incident. 14 CFR §401.5: “An unplanned event during the flight of a
launch vehicle, other than a launch accident, involving a malfunction of a flight
safety system or safety-critical system, or a failure of the licensee’s or
permittee’s safety organization, design, or operations.”

place (as defined in a license the Secretary issues or transfers under this chapter)
and necessary facilities at that location.”
launch site safety assessment. 14 CFR §401.5: “An FAA assessment of a Federal
launch range to determine if the range meets FAA safety requirements. A
difference between range practice and FAA requirements is documented in the
LSSA.”
launch vehicle. 14 CFR §401.5: “A vehicle built to operate in, or place a payload
in, outer space or a suborbital rocket.”
launch weight (ultralight flight). The total weight of a hang glider or an ultralight
airplane when it is ready for flight. It includes any equipment, instruments and
the maximum quantity of fuel and oil that it is designed to carry but does not
include the weight of any float equipment (to a maximum of 75 lbs), the weight
of the occupant or the weight of any parachute installation.
law of conservation of energy. One of the basic laws of physics stating that
energy can be neither created nor destroyed, but it can be changed from one

form into other forms. Regardless of the form or forms into which the energy is
changed, the total amount of energy always remains the same.
lawrencium. A synthetic, radioactive chemical element. Lawrencium’s symbol is
Lr, and its atomic number is 103. One of the isotopes of lawrencium has a mass
number of 257 and a half-life of eight seconds.
layer (meteorology). With regard to sky cover, layers refer to clouds or other
obscuring phenomena whose bases are at approximately the same level. The
layer may be continuous or composed of detached elements. The term layer does
not imply that a clear space exists between the layers or that the clouds or
obscuring phenomena composing them are of the same type.
lay line (flexible hose). A colored line that runs the length of a piece of flexible
hose. A lay line is used to indicate whether or not the hose was twisted during
installation. If the lay line spirals around the hose, the hose is twisted.
lay-up (composite structure). The placement of the various layers of resinimpregnated fabric in a mold in the process of manufacturing a piece of
laminated composite material.
lazy eight (flight maneuver). A maneuver designed to develop perfect
coordination of controls through a wide range of airspeeds and altitudes so that
certain accuracy points are reached with planned attitude and airspeed. In its
execution, the dive, climb, and turn are all combined, and the combinations are
varied and applied throughout the performance range of the airplane.
L-band radar. Airborne radar which operates in the frequency range of 0.39 to
1.55 gigahertz. The wavelength of L-band radar is between 77 and 19
centimeters.
LC circuit (electrical circuit). An alternating current circuit containing both
inductance (L) and capacitance (C). An LC circuit is considered to have no
resistance. In a purely capacitive circuit, changes in current lead changes in
voltage by 90°. In a purely inductive circuit, current changes lag 90° behind
voltage changes. Because the effects of capacitance and inductance are 180°
apart, the total opposition to the flow of current in an LC circuit is the difference
between the capacitive and the inductive reactances.

LCD (liquid crystal display). A type of visual display used in digital watches,
computers, calculators, and some of the newer aircraft instruments. An
extremely thin layer of a normally transparent liquid crystal material is sealed
between two sheets of glass. The outsides of the two pieces of glass are coated
with an electrically conductive oxide. The oxide coating on one side of the glass
is etched to form the segments of letters and numbers, and each segment is
connected by a printed circuit lead to a connector at the edge of the display.
The back of the display is covered with a reflecting material, and a piece of
transparent polarizing material is placed over the display to polarize the light
passing through it. When light is polarized, all its waves vibrate in the same
plane.
When a voltage is placed between the oxide coatings on the two sides of the
display, the molecules in the liquid crystal material arrange themselves in such a
way that the polarized light cannot pass through them. The liquid crystal
material under the segment having voltage on it shows up as though it were
black against the reflected background.
LCR circuit (electrical circuit). An alternating current circuit containing
inductance (L), capacitance (C), and resistance (R). The total opposition to the
flow of current in an LCR circuit is the circuit impedance (Z), which is the
vector sum of the total reactance (the difference between the inductive and the
capacitive reactances), and the resistance. See impedance.

LDA (localizer-type directional aid). A NAVAID used for nonprecision
instrument approaches, with utility and accuracy comparable to a localizer. An
LDA is not a part of a complete ILS and is not aligned with the runway.
L/DMAX. The maximum ratio between total lift (L) and total drag (D). This
point provides the best glide speed. Any deviation from the best glide speed
increases drag and reduces the distance you can glide.
L/D or lift/drag ratio (aerodynamic parameter). A measure of efficiency of an
airfoil. L/D is the ratio of the lift to the total drag, or the coefficient of lift to the
coefficient of drag at a specified angle of attack. The lift/drag ratio is commonly
called the L-over-D ratio.
lead. A soft, malleable, ductile, bluish-white, dense, metallic chemical element.
Lead’s symbol is Pb, its atomic number is 82, and its atomic weight is 207.19.
Lead is used in the manufacture of soft solder, type metal, plates for lead-acid
batteries, and radiation shielding.
lead-acid battery. A popular form of storage battery used in automobiles and
airplanes. The positive plate of a fully charged lead-acid battery is made of lead
peroxide, and the negative plate is pure lead. The electrolyte is a solution of
sulfuric acid and water. When a lead-acid battery discharges, both plates change
into lead sulfate, and some of the acid in the electrolyte changes into water.
Passing electrical current through a lead-acid battery from its negative terminal
to its positive terminal reverses the chemical action which took place as the
battery discharged, and the battery becomes charged again. In the charging
process, sulfate ions are driven from the plates back into the electrolyte.
lead-off question (in learning process). A question used by an instructor in the
guided discussion method to open up an area for discussion and get it started.
leading current (electrical current). Current flowing in an AC circuit that has
more capacitive reactance than inductive reactance. Current must flow into a
capacitive circuit before voltage can build up across it; therefore, in a capacitive
circuit, the current leads the voltage.
leading edge. The edge of a moving object that reaches a point in space or time
ahead of the rest of the object. In an airplane wing or a helicopter rotor, the
leading edge is the part of the wing or rotor the moving air touches first. In a
pulse of electrical energy, the leading edge is the first part of the pulse that
moves away from the quiescent, or at-rest, state.

leading edge devices (airplane secondary control devices). High lift devices
which are found on the leading edge of the airfoil. The most common types are
fixed slots, movable slats, and leading edge flaps.
leading-edge flap (aerodynamic control). A type of aerodynamic control surface,
used on some airplanes to increase the lift produced by the wing. Part of the
leading edge bends downward to increase the camber (the curvature) of the
airfoil. Increasing the camber increases the pressure difference across the wing,
which in turn increases the lift. Leading-edge flaps are used for both takeoff and
landing, to increase the lift at low airspeed.
lead-lag hinge (helicopter rotor system). The hinge in the root of a helicopter
rotor blade that allows the blade tip to move back and forth in its plane of
rotation. Movement about the lead-lag hinge is called drag, and this movement is
opposed by drag dampers. A lead-lag hinge is also called an alpha hinge.
lead of a screw thread. The linear distance from the apex of one screw thread to
the apex of the next thread. Lead is also the distance the screw advances in one
complete rotation.
lead radial. The radial at which the turn from the DME arc to the inbound course
is started.
leaf brake (sheet metal shop tool). A large bending tool used to make straight
bends across a sheet of metal. The metal to be bent is clamped between a flat
lower jaw and an upper jaw fitted with a radius bar having the proper bend
radius. A heavy leaf, mounted on a hinge, folds up to bend the metal over the
radius bar. A leaf brake is also called a cornice brake.
leaf spring. A flat spring hinged at one end and arched in the center. The load is
applied to the center of the arch and is absorbed as the spring alternately
straightens out and returns to its arched shape.
leakage (electrical). Electrical current that passes through an insulator which is
supposed to stop all flow. The amount of leakage is determined by the dielectric
strength of the insulator and the amount of voltage, or electrical pressure, across
the insulator.
leakage current (semiconductor characteristic). The flow of minority carriers in a
semiconductor device when the junction is reverse-biased. Both high voltage and
high temperature cause electrons to break out of their bonds and leave holes.

These electrons and holes are attracted to the junction, where they recombine
and cause a small amount of current to flow. Leakage current increases as the
temperature of the device increases.
leakage flux (magnetism). Magnetic flux that does not pass directly between the
poles of a magnet. Leakage flux does no useful work.
lean blow out. See lean flameout.
lean flameout (gas turbine engine operation). A condition in which the flame
inside a gas turbine engine goes out because there is not enough fuel for the
amount of air flowing through the engine. Turbine engine fuel controls are
designed to measure the air flowing through the engine and adjust the fuel flow
so a lean flameout, or lean die-out, cannot occur. A lean flameout is also called a
lean die-out.
lean mixture. A fuel-air mixture that contains more than 15 parts of air to 1 part
of fuel, by weight.
leans, the. A physical sensation caused by an abrupt correction of a banked
attitude entered too slowly to stimulate the motion sensing system in the inner
ear. The abrupt correction can create the illusion of banking in the opposite
direction.
learning. A change in behavior as a result of experience.
learning plateau. A learning phenomenon where progress appears to cease or
slow down for a significant period of time before once again increasing.
learning style. Preferred way(s) by which people learn. Common learning styles
include visual, auditory, and kinesthetic (tactile, or hands-on). Learning skills
can be loosely grouped into physical and cognitive styles.
learning theory. A body of principles advocated by psychologists and educators
to explain how people acquire skills, knowledge, and attitudes.
least significant bit. See LSB.
least significant digit. See LSD.
Leclanche cell (batteries). Another name for a carbon-zinc cell. An ordinary
carbon-zinc flashlight battery is an example of a Leclanche cell. The negative

terminal is the zinc can that forms the outside shell, and the positive terminal is a
carbon rod supported inside the can by the electrolyte.
The electrolyte is a moist paste of sal ammoniac (ammonium chloride), with
manganese dioxide mixed in it to absorb the hydrogen bubbles which form on
the carbon rod as the battery is used.
lecture method. An educational presentation usually delivered by an instructor to
a group of students with the use of instructional aids and training devices.
Lectures are useful for the presentation of new material, summarizing ideas, and
showing relationships between theory and practice.
LED (light emitting diode). An optoelectronic device that emits visible light
when electrons pass through it. P and N impurities are mixed with such chemical
compounds as indium phosphide, gallium arsenide, and zinc selenide to form a
P-N junction.
When the P-N junction is reverse-biased (the negative terminal of the voltage
source is connected to the P-material), no electrons flow, and the LED remains
dark. But when the diode is forward-biased (the negative terminal of the voltage
source connected to the N-material), electrons flow through the LED, and it
emits light.

lee side. The side of an island or mountain away from the direction from which
the wind is blowing. The lee side is the side sheltered from the wind.
leeward. Downwind, or the downwind side of an object.
lee wave (meteorology). Any stationary wave disturbance caused by a barrier in
a fluid flow. In the atmosphere, when sufficient moisture is present, lee waves
are evidenced by lenticular clouds on the lee side of mountain barriers. Lee
waves are also called mountain waves or standing waves.
left-hand rule for electric motors. The rule for determining the direction of
movement of a current-carrying conductor in a magnetic field. Hold the left hand

with the thumb, first finger, and second finger extended so they are at right
angles to each other. When the first finger points in the direction of the lines of
magnetic flux (from the north pole to the south pole), and the second finger
points in the direction of conventional current flow (from positive to negative),
the thumb points in the direction the conductor will move. This is also known as
Fleming’s rule for electric motors.
left-hand rule for generators. Arrange the fingers of your left hand in such a way
that the thumb, forefinger, and second finger are at right angles to each other.
The thumb points in the direction the conductor in the armature is moving, the
first finger points in the direction the magnetic flux passes over the conductors
(the flux leaves the north pole and enters the south pole), and the second finger
points in the direction the electrons are flowing in the armature conductors (from
negative to positive).
left-hand rule for the direction of magnetic flux. Grasp a conductor with your left
hand in such a way that the thumb points in the direction electrons are moving
(from the negative terminal of the power source to the positive terminal). Your
fingers encircle the conductor in the same direction as the lines of magnetic flux.
left-hand rule for the polarity of an electromagnet. Grasp the coil of an
electromagnet in such a way that the fingers encircle the coil in the same
direction electrons are flowing (from the negative terminal of the power supply
to the positive terminal). The thumb points to the north pole of the electromagnet
formed by the coil.
left-hand thread. The threads on a bolt or screw which are cut in such a direction
that they wind in a counterclockwise direction. A left-hand thread is turned to
the left, to screw it in.
left-right indicator (navigation instrument). The course-deviation indicator used
with a VOR navigation system. See VOR.
legs of a right triangle. The two sides of a right triangle which are joined by the
right angle.
LEMAC (leading edge of the mean aerodynamic chord). A reference for many
of the aerodynamic measurements used in aircraft design and operation. When
the CG of an airplane is given in % MAC, LEMAC is specified in inches from
the datum to allow weight and balance computations to relate % MAC to the
datum. See MAC.

lenticular cloud (meteorology). A species of cloud whose elements have the
form of more or less isolated, generally smooth lenses or almonds. Lenticular
clouds most often appear in formations on the lee side of a mountain peak as a
result of lee waves, and they remain nearly stationary with respect to the terrain.
Lenticular clouds are an indicator of extreme turbulence.
Lenz’s law (electrical law). The electrical law explaining induced current.
Lenz’s law states that the current induced in a conductor cut by lines of magnetic
flux flows in the direction opposite to that of the current which produced the
lines of flux.
lesson plan. An organized outline for a single instructional period. It is a
necessary guide for the instructor in that it tells what to do, in what order to do it,
and what procedure to use in teaching the material of a lesson.
level (horizontal condition of a body). A flat, horizontal surface of a body is said
to be level when all points on the surface are perpendicular to a line which points
directly toward the center of the earth.
level (spirit level, or bubble level). An indicating device used to show a level
condition. A curved glass tube is almost, but not completely, filled with a clear
liquid, and since the tube is not entirely full, there is a small air bubble in the
liquid. This bubble, being much lighter than the liquid, always rises to the
highest point in the tube.
The curved tube is mounted in a long straight bar, or housing, in such a way
that the bubble rises to the center of the tube when the housing is perpendicular
to the pull of gravity (perpendicular to a line pointing to the center of the earth).
leveling lugs (aircraft component). Brackets or other structural devices installed
in an aircraft in such a way that when the aircraft is in its level-flight attitude, a
straightedge placed across the lugs will be level.
leveling means (aircraft specification). The method specified by the aircraft
manufacturer to determine the level-flight attitude of an aircraft. The leveling
means may require the use of a spirit level or a plumb bob.
level of free convection (meteorology). The level at which a parcel of air lifted
dry-adiabatically until it becomes saturated, and then moist-adiabatically would
become warmer than its surroundings in a conditionally unstable atmosphere.
lever. A rigid bar, free to pivot, or rotate about a point called the fulcrum with an

input force applied to one point, and an output force taken from another point.
The lever, one of the simple machines like the wheel, screw, and inclined plane,
can be used to change a force or the speed of movement.
The action of a lever is determined by the placement of the fulcrum and by the

occupants to operate in an environment that does not support life. Oxygen
systems and pressurization systems are examples of life-support systems.
lift (aerodynamic force). An aerodynamic force caused by air flowing over a
specially shaped surface called an airfoil. The airfoil is curved in such a way that
the air flowing over the upper surface finds the surface falling away from it. The
air is being pressed onto the surface by the air above it, and in order for it to
remain on the surface, it must speed up. As the air speeds up, its pressure drops,
and the air above it flows down to fill the low-pressure area.
The air below the airfoil finds the surface rising into its flow path, and this
slows the air. As the air slows down, its pressure rises, and it forces the

surrounding air away from it. The combination of the low pressure pulling air
down to the airfoil and the high pressure forcing air away from the airfoil causes
the air to be deflected downward. When an airfoil forces air downward, a force
equal to the weight of the deflected air forces the airfoil upward. This force is
called lift.

lift coefficient (aerodynamic parameter). A dimensionless number used in the
formula for aerodynamic lift that varies with the shape of the airfoil and the
angle of attack. The lift coefficient (CL) is obtained from wind tunnel data and is
plotted on a set of airfoil characteristic curves.

several inches in diameter may be cut in a piece of metal at a point where the
metal is not needed for strength; for example, in the web of a wing rib. The
edges of the hole are flanged (bent outward) to give the metal rigidity. A piece of
metal with flanged lightening holes is more rigid than the metal before the
lightening holes were cut.

and dirigibles are examples of lighter-than-air aircraft made of materials that are
heavier than air, but are filled with a gas (or with hot air) that is less dense than
the surrounding air.
When a gas-filled aircraft displaces a greater weight of air than it weighs,
aerostatic lift is produced, and the aircraft rises into the air. 14 CFR Part 1:
“Aircraft that can rise and remain suspended by using contained gas weighing
less than the air that is displaced by the gas.”
light gun (air traffic control). A handheld directional light signaling light device
used for controlling traffic operating in the vicinity of the airport and on the

or negative Gs (one G is equal to the weight of the aircraft) an aircraft can
sustain before structural damage occurs. The load limit varies with the design of
the aircraft. For example; the maximum limit load of a normal category airplane
must be not less than 3.8G positive and 1.52G negative.
limit switch (electrical switch). A precision electrical switch, used to turn a
mechanism on or off when some part of the mechanism reaches a specific

actuating control, and they actuate at exactly the same position of the control
each time.
Lindberg fire detection system. A type of aircraft fire detection system that
detects either a fire or a general overheat condition. The detector element
consists of a sealed, stainless steel tube filled with a material that absorbs gas
when it is cool and releases it when it is heated. This tube is fitted with a
pressure-actuated switch that initiates a fire warning signal when the tube is
heated and releases enough gas to close the switch.

having to take the aircraft into a hangar or maintenance dock. Troubleshooting,
minor repairs, systems servicing, and the removal and replacement of many
components are classified as line maintenance.
linen. A type of cloth made from yarn spun from fibers of the flax plant. Linen
has been used for centuries as a fine cloth for clothing, and at one time was
popular as a fabric for covering airplane structures.
line-of-sight radio reception. A characteristic of certain radio signals that causes
them to act in the same way as light. These signals travel in straight lines and
cannot bend around obstructions. Very-high-frequency (VHF) and ultra-highfrequency (UHF) communications are line-of-sight transmissions which require
a clear path between the transmitting and receiving antennas. The reception
distance of VHF and UHF signals is dependent upon the altitude of the aircraft
above the transmitting antenna.
line oriented flight training (LOFT). A program in flight crew training to
facilitate the transition from the simulator to line flying for airline pilot trainees.
It consists of a training course with representative flight segments of the
operator’s route, which include normal operating procedures from push back at
one airport to arrival at another, and abnormal and emergency flight operations.
line-overs. A dangerous situation in which the suspension line goes over the top
of the powered parachute’s wing instead of going straight from the wing to the
riser system. This condition will prevent proper inflation of the wing.
lines of flux (magnetism). Invisible lines of magnetic force that pass between the
north and south poles of a magnet.
line twist. Occurs when the powered parachute suspension lines on both sides of
the wing are spiraled together. Flying with a line twist is unsafe; the wing is
unairworthy until it is corrected.
line voltage (electrical power system). The voltage measured at the power line
which supplies power to a piece of electrical equipment. In an installation using
alternating current, this voltage is the effective, or rms, value of the AC.
line-voltage regulator (electrical system component). A piece of electronic
equipment, used to stabilize the line voltage supplied to a piece of electrical or
electronic equipment. Circuits in the line-voltage regulator increase the output
voltage when the load current increases to prevent the output voltage dropping.

And they decrease the voltage when the load decreases, preventing the output
voltage rising above the regulated value.
line up and wait (LUAW) (airport operations). A phrase that air traffic
controllers use when instructing a pilot to taxi onto the departure runway and to
“line up and wait” — not as authorization for takeoff, but used when takeoff
clearance cannot be immediately issued due to traffic or other reasons. Aircraft
instructed to LUAW will be informed by ATC of the closest traffic within 6
flying miles that have requested a full-stop, touch-and-go, stop-and-go, or an
unrestricted low approach to the same runway.
link. On a webpage, a reference to data that a user can click on to be directed to

usually identified by their appearance in a different format (font color,
underlining), or as a button (picture or icon) communicating access to additional
information or a new webpage.
link rod (radial reciprocating engine component). The rod in a radial engine that
connects one of the piston wrist pins to a knuckle pin on the master rod. Link
rods are also called articulated rods. See articulated connecting rod.

takes the shape of its container, but does not expand to fill the entire container.
Water and gasoline are examples of liquids.
liquid air. Air that has been changed into its liquid state by lowering its
temperature below the boiling points of oxygen and nitrogen (the main
constituents of air). Liquid air is an extremely cold, faintly bluish, transparent
liquid. For air to remain in its liquid state, it must be stored in a special insulated
container. If liquified air is allowed to boil, the first gas released is nitrogen, and
then, when the nitrogen has all boiled away, the oxygen turns into a gas. Both
nitrogen and oxygen are produced commercially by boiling liquid air.
liquid-cooled engine (reciprocating engine). A reciprocating engine that uses a
liquid, such as water or ethylene glycol, to remove excess heat. Much of the heat
energy in the fuel burned in an engine is wasted and must be carried away from
the engine, or it will cause damage.

In a liquid-cooled engine, the liquid coolant circulates around the cylinders in
jackets and absorbs heat. This absorbed heat is carried outside the engine in the
coolant, and as the coolant passes through a radiator (a liquid-to-air heat
exchanger), the unwanted heat is given up to the outside air.
liquid cooling (engine cooling). The removal of unwanted heat from an aircraft
engine by transferring it into a liquid and then passing the heated liquid through
a liquid-to-air heat exchanger (radiator) to transfer the heat into the surrounding
air.
liquid crystal. A type of liquid whose molecules can be arranged by electrical
charges in such a way that polarized light cannot pass through a film of the
liquid. Liquid crystal is used in the displays for calculators, clocks, watches, and
in the new generation of aircraft instruments.

liquid nitrogen. Nitrogen that has been changed into its liquid state by lowering
its temperature. Nitrogen remains in its liquid state under standard atmospheric
pressure when its temperature is kept at –195°C (78°K) or lower.

lowering its temperature. LOX remains a liquid if its temperature is kept at
−183°C (90°K) or lower.
Lissajous figures. Figures formed on the screen of a cathode-ray oscilloscope
that show the relationship between the frequency of sine wave signals being
applied to the horizontal and vertical inputs. If the frequency and phase of the
two sine wave signals are the same, the Lissajous figure will be in the shape of a
circle. If the frequency of the sine wave signal applied to the vertical input is two
times that of the signal applied to the horizontal plates, the Lissajous figure will
be shaped like a figure eight (8).
liter. A metric unit of volume. One liter is the volume of one kilogram of pure

Lithium’s symbol is Li, its atomic number is 3, and its atomic weight is 6.939.

Lithium is the lightest of the metals, and it is used as an ingredient in batteries
and as an alloying agent for other metals.
lithium cell (primary electrical cell). A lightweight, high-energy primary
electrical cell, useful because of its long shelf life. A lithium cell uses lithium
metal as its negative electrode and a gas dissolved in an electrolyte as its positive
electrode. Lithium cells produce an open-circuit voltage of between 2.8 and 3.6
volts, which is about twice the open-circuit voltage of most other primary cells.

Lithium grease is highly water resistant and is useful for low-temperature
lubricating applications.
lithium polymer (LiPo) battery. A rechargeable battery that uses lithium and a
gelled polymer electrolyte in a pouch-like housing. The average consumer LiPo
battery is essentially a lithium-ion battery with minor modifications. LiPo
batteries are preferred to NiCad batteries due to their lighter weight, higher
capacities, and high potential discharge rates. Unfortunately, they are more
susceptible to failure and fire, and LiPo battery fires can become uncontrollable
in short period of time.
lithometeor (meteorology). The general term for dry particles suspended in the
atmosphere. Lithometeors include dust, haze, smoke, and sand.
lithosphere. The outer crust of the earth. The lithosphere is made mostly of rock
and is considered to extend down for about 50 miles.

or a base (alkali). Litmus turns red when it is acted on by an acid and blue when
acted on by a base.
litmus paper. An indicator paper, used to determine whether a solution is acidic
or basic (alkaline). Litmus paper is made by soaking a piece of absorbent paper
in a solution of litmus powder dissolved in water. When blue litmus paper is wet
with an acid solution, it turns red, and when red litmus paper is wet with an
alkaline solution, it turns blue.
Litzendraht wire (litz wire). A special type of conductor, used for carrying highfrequency alternating current. Litz wire is made of fine strands of insulated wire,
woven together in such a way that any individual strand occupies, at some time,

every position in the cross section of the conductor. This special type of
construction gives litz wire its low opposition to the flow of high-frequency AC.
live center (machine tool component). A sharp-pointed center that fits into the
headstock of a lathe and turns with it. The material to be turned is mounted
between the live center and the dead center and is turned by a lathe dog that
clamps the material and turns with the faceplate.

LNAV. Lateral (azimuth) navigation guidance. A type of navigation associated
with nonprecision approach procedures or en route navigation.
LNAV/VNAV. Lateral navigation/vertical navigation minimums provided for

avionics approved for LNAV/VNAV, certified barometric VNAV with IFR
approach certified GPS). Procedure minimums altitude is published as DA
(decision altitude).
load (electrical). A device that uses electrical power. A load converts electrical
energy into some other form of energy: mechanical, heat, light, or chemical.
load bank (electrical component). A heavy-duty electrical resistor, used to
dissipate large amounts of electrical energy. Load banks are used to discharge
storage batteries for servicing them and to dissipate large amounts of current
when loading a generator as is done with a reciprocating engine dynamometer.
load cell (electronic weighing system component). A component in an electronic
weighing system that contains strain gages. When an aircraft is weighed, the
load cells are placed between the jacks and the jack pads on the aircraft, and the
aircraft is raised by the jacks. The weight of the aircraft compresses the load
cells, and the compression changes the resistance of the strain gages. The change
in this resistance is converted into units of weight the load cell is supporting.
load factor (aircraft structure). The ratio of the amount of load imposed on an
aircraft structure to the weight of the structure itself. Load factors imposed on an
aircraft in flight are measured by accelerometers and are expressed in terms of
G-units (gravity units).
14 CFR Part 1: “The ratio of a specified load to the total weight of the aircraft.
The specified load is expressed in terms of any of the following: aerodynamic
forces, inertia forces, or ground or water reactions.”

indexes. Diagonal lines for each item relate the weight to the moment index
without having to use mathematics.

weight of the loaded aircraft, the maximum allowable takeoff weight for that
flight, the center of gravity limits, the center of gravity of the loaded aircraft, the
registration number of the aircraft or flight number, the origin and destination
and identification of crew members and their crew position assignments.
load matching network (electrical circuit). An electrical circuit used to match the
input impedance of an electrical load to the output impedance of a power circuit,
such as an amplifier.
loadmeter (electrical instrument). A type of ammeter installed between the
generator output and the main bus in an aircraft electrical system. Loadmeters
are calibrated in percentage of the generator’s rated output, rather than in
amperes.
LOC. See localizer.
local action (battery discharge). The gradual self discharge of a battery on
storage caused by internal chemical action.
local airport advisory (air traffic control). A service provided by flight service
stations or the military at airports not serviced by an operating control tower.
This service consists of providing information to arriving and departing aircraft
concerning wind direction and speed, favored runway, altimeter setting,
pertinent known traffic, pertinent known field conditions, airport taxi routes and
traffic patterns, and authorized instrument approach procedures. This
information is advisory in nature and does not constitute an ATC clearance.
Currently this service is only available in Alaska.

local area augmentation system (LAAS). A differential global positioning
system (DGPS) that improves the accuracy of the system by determining
position error from the GPS satellites, then transmitting the error, or corrective
factors, to the airborne GPS receiver.
localizer (instrument landing system). The portion of an instrument landing
system (ILS) that directs the pilot of an aircraft down the center line of the
instrument runway for the final approach in an instrument landing. The localizer
transmits two signals, one modulated with a 90-hertz tone, and the other with a
150-hertz tone. These two signals are transmitted from highly directional
antennas so they overlap along the center line of the runway by two and a half
degrees. The vertical needle of the cross-pointer indicator in the aircraft responds
to these two signals. When the aircraft is flying along a path lined up with the
center line of the runway, the needle is centered. When the aircraft moves to one
side of the center line or the other, the signal for the side it is on is the stronger,
and the needle swings over to show the side of the runway over which the
airplane is flying.
localizer course (ICAO). The locus of points, in any given horizontal plane, at
which the DDM (difference in depth of modulation) is zero.
localizer offset (air traffic control). An angular offset of the localizer from the
runway extended center line in a direction away from the no transgression zone
(NTZ) that increases the normal operating zone (NOZ) width. An offset requires
a 50-foot increase in the decision height (DH) and is not authorized for CAT II
and CAT III approaches.
localizer performance with vertical guidance (LPV). An instrument approach
that combines WAAS lateral and vertical guidance. This approach has
minimums similar to an ILS but is limited to areas where terrain is not a
challenge. Approach minimums as low as 200 feet HAT and 1 /2 SM visibility
are possible, even though LPV is still considered a semi-precision, not a
precision, approach. However, like precision approaches (such as an ILS
approach), LPVs have a decision altitude (DA).
localizer-type directional aid (air traffic control). A NAVAID used for
nonprecision instrument approaches, with utility and accuracy comparable to a
localizer but not a part of a complete ILS and not aligned with the runway.

localizer usable distance. The maximum distance from the localizer transmitter
at a specified altitude as verified by flight inspection, at which reliable course
information is continuously received.
local Mach number. The Mach number of any isolated, or localized, flow of air
over an aircraft structure. Because of the shape of the aircraft structure, the local
Mach number is often higher than the flight Mach number of the aircraft. Shock
waves normally form on an aircraft structure when the air passing over the
structure reaches a speed of Mach one, the speed of sound.
local oscillator (radio receiver circuit). An electronic oscillator in a
superheterodyne radio receiver. A superheterodyne receiver is highly selective
because it selects an extremely narrow band of frequencies and rejects all
frequencies on either side.
A radio-frequency (RF) signal is picked up by the receiver and mixed with a
signal produced by the local oscillator, which is tuned with the same tuning
control used to select the RF signal. Since both the local oscillator and the RF
signal are tuned at the same time, the frequency of the local oscillator is always
the same number of kilohertz or megahertz different from the RF, regardless of
the frequency of the RF.
The difference frequency between the received RF and the frequency produced
by the local oscillator is filtered and amplified through the remaining stages of
the receiver. This frequency is called the intermediate frequency, the IF.
local traffic (air traffic control). Aircraft operating in the traffic pattern or within
sight of the tower, aircraft known to be departing or arriving from flight in local
practice areas, or aircraft executing practice instrument approaches at the airport.

locator, collocated with a middle marker (MM).
locator outer marker (LOM). NDB compass locator, collocated with an outer
marker (OM).
lockbolt (structural fastener). A type of fastener that may be used where high
strength is required in major structural components. The lockbolt consists of a
stump and a collar. The stump, which has a number of locking grooves around
the end of its shank, is inserted into a prepared hole, often with an interference

fit. A collar made, of a crushable material is placed over the grooved end of the
stump. The head of the lockbolt is supported with a heavy bucking bar and the
collar is swaged down into the grooves with a special swaging set in a rivet gun.
There is also a blind lockbolt that has a long grooved shank with a shear
groove. The lockbolt is put through the hole and the collar is slipped over the
shank. A special pulling-tool is clamped over the grooves and, as it is pulled, a
die forces the collar into the locking grooves. Continued pulling breaks the stem
at the shear groove.
locked-rotor current (electric motor specification). The steady-state current
flowing through the windings of an electric motor when the rotor is held in a
locked position with the rated voltage applied to it. Locked-rotor current is much
higher than the running current, because as soon as the rotor begins to turn, it
generates a counterelectromotive force that opposes the source voltage and
decreases the running current.
lockout debooster (brake system component). A component in an aircraft power
brake system, used to reduce the pressure between the brake control valve and
the wheel cylinder. A lock-out debooster shuts off the flow of fluid to the wheel
cylinder if the line should break. See debooster.
lock ring (safety device). A retaining ring used to prevent a shaft moving
lengthwise out of a hole. A groove is cut around the outside of the shaft, and the
spring steel lock ring grips the groove and holds the shaft in place.
A lock ring is made in the shape of an open circle, with tabs at both of its ends
so a pair of special lock ring pliers can be used to expand the ring enough for it
to slip over the shaft. When the ring is over the groove, the pliers are released,
and the spring action of the lock ring holds it tight in the groove. Lock rings are
made for both external and internal grooves.

lockstitch (aircraft fabric covering). A type of stitch used to prevent an entire
hand-sewed seam loosening if the thread should break at any point. When
making a sewed-in patch to aircraft fabric, the patch is sewed in using a baseball
stitch. At every eight to ten stitches, the seam is locked with a modified seine
knot.
lock tab (mechanical locking device). A type of mechanical lock, used to prevent
a nut from loosening on a shaft. A locking hole or keyway is cut in the shaft and
the internal tab on the lock ring is slipped into it. The nut is screwed down onto
the shaft and tightened to the proper torque; then one or more of the external
locking tabs are bent up against the flats of the nut to keep it from backing off
and becoming loose.
lockwire. A term used for safety wire. Lockwire is soft brass, stainless steel, or
galvanized low-carbon steel wire, used to safety fasteners so they will not loosen
by vibration. Lockwire is passed through holes in the fasteners and twisted, then
secured to a hole in an adjacent fastener or to a hole in the structure. Twisted
lockwire should always pull on the fastener in the direction that tries to tighten
it.
lodestone. A natural magnetic iron oxide. Lodestones were discovered in ancient
times and were the first devices to be used as a magnetic compass. The term
lodestone comes from “leading stone.”
log (record). A record kept of activities, with entries made as they occur. In the
field of aviation, a log is kept by pilots to record flight time. A log is kept on
every airframe, engine, propeller, and rotor, to show the amount of time in
service and to record all the maintenance that has been done on each device.
logarithm. The exponent used to indicate the power to which a base number
must be raised to obtain a given number. In the expression 64 = 1,296, the base
number is 6, and 4 is the power to which 6 must be raised to get 1,296. Four is
the logarithm of 1,296 to the base 6.
logarithmic curve. A mathematical curve plotted in such a way that the
coordinate of any point varies as the logarithm of the other coordinate.

logbook (pilot’s record book). A register book that lists a pilot’s flight time,
instructor endorsements, and completed training topics.
logic. The branch of science that deals with the principles used in truth tables.
Logic has become of major importance, with the introduction of digital
electronics and especially digital computers. Electronic logic uses Boolean
algebra, which allows a person to set up conditions using such operators as
AND, OR, NOT, IF, ONLY IF, or THEN. By using these conditions and
answering them with YES or NO that can be produced by a switch being open or
closed, logic conclusions can be reached.
Electronic logic circuits use gates which are combinations of switches with a
single output, but with one or more inputs. For any given combination of logic
conditions (yes or no, one or zero) on the inputs, there can be one and only one
logic condition on the output. The most commonly used logic gates are the AND
gate, the OR gate, and the NOT gate (an inverter). See the definitions for each of
these gates.
logic circuit. An electronic circuit that operates according to the fundamental
laws of logic.
logic decision. A decision based on logic. This is the type of decision made by a
digital computer when there are two possible conditions or alternatives.
If a computer is instructed to count ten items and then turn off the power to a
motor, it will count one item and then ask for a logic decision to be made: “Have
ten items been counted?” If the answer is NO, the computer will make the logic
decision to count again. After the tenth item has been counted and the computer
asks the question “have ten items been counted?” the answer is now YES, and
the computer will make the logic decision to turn off the power to the motor.
A decision point where the computer is asked to make a logic decision is
shown on a flowchart as a diamond.
logic flowchart. A graphic way to show the flow of information through a
computer program. An oval shape shows the point at which the program starts or

stops. A rectangular box is an information box that explains something. A box
shaped like a parallelogram is a point where data is put into the program or taken
from it. A diamond-shaped box is a decision point at which a logic decision must
be made.
logic functions (logic gates). Some of the logic functions, or gates, most
frequently used in digital computers are: AND, OR, NOT, NOR, NAND, and
EXCLUSIVE OR. See definitions of each of these terms.

logic one. One of the two conditions (zero and one) used when working with
digital electronic equipment. A logic one represents a YES or a TRUE condition,
and it is produced by a closed switch or by the presence of a voltage.
logic probe. An electronic instrument that determines the logic level, or state, (0
or 1) at specific points in a digital circuit.
logic state. The logic condition of a conductor in a piece of digital electronic
equipment—that is, whether the conductor is carrying a logic zero or a logic one.
logic zero. One of the two conditions (zero and one) used when working with
digital electronic equipment. A logic zero represents a NO or a FALSE
condition, and it is produced by an open switch or by no voltage.
LOM. See locator outer marker.
lomcovàk (aerobatic maneuver). A family of high-precision maneuvers in which
the gyroscopic action of the propeller works with the aerodynamic forces to
cause the airplane to tumble end over end and rotate about all three of its axes.
longeron (aircraft structural component). The main longitudinal, load-bearing
members of a truss-type aircraft fuselage.
long-call reserve (in flight operations). This describes a situation in which a
flightcrew member, prior to beginning the rest period required by 14 CFR
§117.25, is notified by the certificate holder to report for a flight duty period
following the completion of the rest period.

longitude (navigation). The angular east-west measurement of location on the
earth’s surface. The surface of the earth is divided by 360 meridians, or lines of
longitude, that pass through both the north and south poles. The meridian
passing through the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, near London, England, is
0° longitude and is called the prime meridian. On the opposite side of the earth is
the 180° meridian. Longitude east of the prime meridian is called east longitude,
and that west of the prime meridian is called west longitude.
longitudinal axis of an aircraft. An imaginary line through an aircraft from nose
to tail, passing through its center of gravity. The longitudinal axis is also called
the roll axis of the aircraft. Movement of the ailerons rotates an airplane about its
longitudinal axis. See axes of an aircraft.

longitudinal balance (aircraft stability). Balance around lateral, or pitch, axis of
an aircraft.
longitudinal magnetization. A method of magnetizing a part for magnetic
particle inspection. Current flows through a solenoid, or coil, that encircles the
part so the lines of magnetic flux pass lengthwise through it. Longitudinal
magnetism makes it possible to detect faults that extend across the part.
longitudinal separation (air traffic control). The longitudinal spacing of aircraft
at the same altitude by a minimum distance expressed in units of time or miles.
longitudinal stability (aircraft stability). The tendency of an airplane to remain
level about its lateral axis. (The lateral axis passes through the center of gravity
and extends outward parallel to the span of the wing.) Longitudinal stability, also
called pitch stability, is provided by a downward aerodynamic load on the
horizontal tail surface. The center of gravity, which does not change with
airspeed, causes the airplane to rotate nose-down about its lateral axis. The tail
load, which does change with airspeed, is located behind the center of gravity,
and it causes the airplane to rotate nose-up about its lateral axis.

If the nose pitches down, the airspeed builds up, and the downward tail load
increases. This brings the nose back to a level flight attitude. If the nose pitches
up, the airspeed slows down, and the tail load decreases. The center of gravity
causes the nose to return to a level flight attitude.
longitudinal wave. Waves within an elastic material in which the particles in
motion move back and forth, parallel to the direction the wave is traveling.
long-range communication system. A system that uses satellite relay, data link,
high frequency, or other approved communication system which extends beyond
line of sight.
long-range navigation system. An electronic navigation system that is approved
for use under instrument flight rules as a primary means of navigation and has at
least one source of navigation input, such as inertial navigation system, global
positioning system, Omega/very low frequency, or LORAN C.
long-term memory. The portion of the brain that stores information that has been
determined to be of sufficient value to be retained. In order for the information
to be retained in long-term memory, it must have been processed or coded in the
working memory.
loom (electrical wiring). A type of flexible, braided insulating material put over
a wire or a bundle of wires to protect it against physical damage caused by heat
or abrasion.
loop (aircraft maneuver). A flight maneuver in the vertical plane in which an
airplane passes successively through a climb, inverted flight, dive, and then
returns to normal flight.
loop (electrical circuit). A complete path in an electrical circuit through which
current flows from one terminal of the power source back to the opposite
terminal.
loop antenna (radio direction finding). A type of directional antenna, used with
radio direction finding equipment to determine the direction to the station
transmitting the signal the loop is receiving. Loop antennas must be used with a
sense antenna to show the side of the loop on which the transmitting antenna is
located.
loopstick antenna. A type of radio antenna made of a number of turns of wire
wound around a rod of powdered iron. The powdered iron increases the

permeability of the core of the coil and increases the radio signal picked up by
the coil.
LORAN (electronic navigation system). A type of electronic navigation system,
used by aircraft and ships. The name LORAN comes from LOng RAnge
Navigation. LORAN is a low-frequency pulse navigation system based on
latitude and longitude coordinates. Hyperbolic lines of position are determined
by measuring the difference in the time of reception of synchronized pulse
signals from two fixed transmitters. LORAN A operates in the 1750-1950 kHz
frequency band. LORAN C and D operate in the 100-110 kHz frequency band.
LORAN is being phased out and replaced by GPS as the primary electronic
navigation system for aircraft.
loss of control (LOC) (flight). A significant deviation of an aircraft from the
intended flight path; often results from an aircraft upset.
loss of separation (aircraft traffic control). An occurrence or operation that
results in less than prescribed separation between aircraft, or between an aircraft
and a vehicle, pedestrian, or object.
lost communications. Loss of the ability to communicate by radio. Aircraft in
this condition are sometimes referred to as NORDO (no radio). Standard pilot
procedures for lost communications are specified in 14 CFR Part 91.
lost-wax casting. A method of casting such components as turbine blades. A
highly polished internal cavity is made in the die, having the exact inverse shape
of the finished part, and a special molten wax is injected into it to completely fill
the cavity. When the wax solidifies, it is removed from the die.
Several of the wax patterns are assembled on a wax gating tree, which is then
dipped into a liquid ceramic slurry a number of times until a ceramic coat about
a quarter of an inch thick builds up. The resulting ceramic mold is fired at a
temperature of about 1,000°C, which melts the wax out and prepares the mold
for the next steps. The extremely hot mold is filled with the blade alloy which
has been melted in an induction furnace. After the metal has cooled, the mold is
removed and the blades are cleaned and inspected.
louver. A slotted opening in a structure, used for the passage of cooling air.
Louvers are often fitted with vanes to control the amount of air flowing through
them.
low (meteorology). An area of low barometric pressure, with its attendant

system of winds. A low is also called a barometric depression or cyclone.
low altitude airway structure. The network of airways serving aircraft operations,
up to, but not including, 18,000 feet MSL.
low-altitude alert system. See LAAS.
low approach. An approach over an airport or runway following an instrument
approach or a VFR approach, including the go-around maneuver in which the
pilot intentionally does not make contact with the runway.
low blower (supercharger operation). The operation of a two-speed supercharger
at its low impeller speed.
low-bypass engine. A turbofan engine whose bypass ratio is less than 2:1. See
bypass ratio.
low-frequency radio waves. Electromagnetic waves with frequencies between 30
and 300 kilohertz. Low-frequency radio waves have wavelengths between
10,000 and 1,000 meters.
low-lead 100-octane aviation gasoline. A type of aviation gasoline having an
octane rating of 100, but containing a maximum of two milliliters of tetraethyl
lead per gallon. Normal, or high-lead, 100-octane aviation gasoline is allowed to
have as much as 4.6 milliliters of lead per gallon, and this additional lead fouls
the spark plugs of engines designed to use fuel with a lower lead content. Lowlead 100-octane aviation gasoline is dyed blue to distinguish it from normal 100octane aviation gasoline which is dyed green.
low-level air route. In the low-level airspace, a route extending upwards from the
surface of the earth and within which ATC service is not provided.
low-level airspace. All airspace within the National Airspace System below
18,000 feet MSL.
low-oxygen concentration cell corrosion. Corrosion that forms between the lap
joints of metal and under labeling tape, tabs or placards that trap and hold
moisture. Moisture on the surface of the metal absorbs oxygen from the air, and
the extra oxygen causes the water to attract electrons from the metal to form
negative hydroxide ions. Moisture trapped in the lap joints does not have any
extra oxygen and therefore does not form any negative ions. Since the metal in
the lap joints has not given up any electrons, it is more negative than the metal

around it, and it becomes the anode in a corrosion cell and forms a salt of the
metal—it corrodes.
low-pass filter (electronic filter). A type of electronic filter that passes all
frequencies of alternating current below a certain frequency, but blocks or
attenuates all higher frequencies.

low-pressure compressor (gas turbine engine component). The first-stage
compressor in a dual-spool gas turbine engine. The low-pressure compressor is
called the N1 compressor and its speed is not governed. It seeks its own best
speed as the atmospheric conditions change so it can furnish the optimum mass
of air to the inlet of the second-stage compressor.
low-pressure oxygen system. A gaseous oxygen system in which the oxygen is
carried in steel cylinders under a pressure of approximately 450 psi. Lowpressure oxygen systems were used in military aircraft during World War II, but
these systems have been replaced by high-pressure systems or liquid oxygen
(LOX) systems.
low-tension ignition system. A type of magneto ignition system designed for
reciprocating engines that operate at high altitude. The coil in a low-tension
magneto has only one winding, the one that compares with the primary coil in a
high-tension magneto. A carbon-brush-type distributor directs the low voltage
from the magneto to the proper cylinder.
Each spark plug has its own step-up transformer, to change the low distributor
voltage to the high voltage needed to jump the gap in the spark plug. Lowtension ignition systems are not popular today because most aircraft that fly at
high altitudes are turbine powered.
low unmetered fuel pressure. The pressure in a Teledyne-Continental fuel
injector pump that is adjusted by the relief valve.

LOX. The abbreviation for liquid oxygen. See liquid oxygen.
LPV. See localizer performance with vertical guidance.
LR circuit (electrical circuit). An alternating current circuit containing
inductance (L) and resistance (R). The total opposition to the current in an LR
circuit is impedance (Z), which is the vector sum of the inductive reactance and
the resistance.

LRU (line replaceable unit). Components in an aircraft that are designed so that
they can be replaced as a unit while the aircraft is on the flight line.
LSA. See light sport aircraft
LSB (least significant bit). The bit in a binary number that has the lowest place
value. The LSB is the bit on the extreme right.
LSD (least significant digit). The digit in a decimal number that has the lowest
place value. The LSD is the digit on the extreme right.
LSI (large scale integration). A method of miniaturization of electronic circuit
components, in which 100 or more gates are built into a single integrated circuit
(IC) chip. LSI techniques lower the cost per gate of logic components.
LTA. lighter-than-air
lubber line. The reference line used in a magnetic compass or directional gyro, to
indicate the nose of the aircraft. The heading of the aircraft is shown as the
degrees on the card or dial of the instrument opposite the lubber line.
lubricant. A natural or synthetic material used to reduce the friction between
parts in sliding contact with each other. Even parts that seem to be smooth
actually have microscopically rough surfaces. When one rough surface slides
over another, the surfaces lock and oppose the movement (this is called friction).
A lubricant between the surfaces holds them apart, and they slide over a film of

the lubricant, rather than over each other. Lubricants may be in the form of a dry
powder (powdered graphite or molybdenum), a liquid (oil), or a semi-liquid
(grease).
Lucite. The registered trade name for a transparent acrylic resin. Lucite is a
thermoplastic resin, used for windshields and side windows of some aircraft.
luminance. The amount of light emitted or scattered by a surface. Luminance is
measured in lamberts.
luminescence. The production of light by some method other than incandescence
(light emitted because of high temperature). Luminescence may be caused by
friction, chemical action, or electrical charges, and regardless of the method of
luminescence, the light produces little or no heat.
luminous paint. A type of paint having components that cause it to emit light, or
glow in the dark. Radium was, at one time, the main component in luminous
paint. But because of its harmful characteristics, it has been replaced by other
materials. Luminous paint is used on instrument dials and pointers to make them
visible in the dark.
lutetium. A silvery-white, rare-earth chemical element. Lutetium’s symbol is Lu,
its atomic number is 71, and its atomic weight is 174.97. Lutetium is the heaviest
of the rare-earth elements and is used in nuclear technology.
lye. A strong alkaline solution made of potassium hydroxide or sodium
hydroxide.

MAA (maximum authorized altitude). A published altitude representing the
maximum usable altitude or flight level for an airspace structure or route
segment. MAA is the highest altitude on a Federal airway, jet route, area
navigation low or high route, or other direct route for which an MEA is
designated in 14 CFR Part 95, at which adequate reception of navigation aid
signals is assured.
MAC (mean aerodynamic chord). The chord of an imaginary airfoil that has the
same aerodynamic characteristics as the actual airfoil. The length of the MAC is
given for many aircraft, and the CG is expressed in percent of the mean
aerodynamic chord (% MAC).

Mach compensating device. A device that alerts the pilot of inadvertent
excursions beyond the aircraft’s certified maximum operating speed.
Mach cone. The cone-shaped shock wave produced by a sharp-pointed object
moving through the atmosphere at a speed greater than the speed of sound.
machine bolt. The common name for a hex-head bolt.

machine language (computer operation). A language, made up of zeros and ones,
that is usable by a digital computer. Machine language is difficult to write into a
computer, so compilers and assemblers are used. A compiler is a special
program that converts a high-level language that is easy for a programmer to use,
into machine language that can be used by the computer. An assembler converts
assembly language programs into machine language the computer can use.
machine screw. A blunt-end screw with uniform threads that can be screwed into
a tapped hole or a nut. A machine screw is turned with a screwdriver and may
have a round, flat, truss, oval, or fillister head.

machine-sewn seams (aircraft fabric covering). Seams in aircraft fabric made
with a sewing machine. French fell, folded fell, and plain overlap are the seams
most generally used.

machining. The process of removing material by turning, planing, shaping,
milling, or otherwise cutting with machine-operated tools. Lathes, milling
machines, shapers, and planers are the most commonly used machine tools.
machinist. A person skilled in the use of such metalworking machine tools as
lathes, shapers, planers, and milling machines.
Machmeter. A flight instrument that indicates the flight Mach number of an
aircraft. The mechanism inside a Machmeter includes a bellows that measures
the difference between pitot pressure and static pressure. It also contains an
aneroid that modifies the output of the differential pressure bellows to correct for
the changes in altitude.
Mach number. A measurement of speed based on the ratio of the speed of the
aircraft to the speed of sound under the same atmospheric conditions. An
airplane flying at Mach 1 is flying at the speed of sound. 14 CFR Part 1: “The
ratio of true airspeed to the speed of sound.”
Mach technique (ICAO). A control technique used by air traffic control whereby
turbojet aircraft operating successively along suitable routes are cleared to
maintain appropriate Mach numbers for a relevant portion of the enroute phase
of flight. The principal objective is to achieve improved utilization of the
airspace and to ensure that separation between successive aircraft does not
decrease below the established minimums.
Mach tuck (aerodynamics). A flight condition that can occur when operating a
swept wing airplane in the transonic speed range. Under certain conditions a
shock wave forms in the root portion of the wing and causes the air behind it to
separate. This shock-induced separation causes the center of lift to move aft. At
the same time, the disturbed air causes the horizontal stabilizer to lose some of
its effectiveness. The airplane develops a nose-down pitch, or tucks under. See
shock stall.
mackerel sky (meteorology). A condition of cloud coverage of the sky consisting
of rows of altocumulus or cirrocumulus clouds. These clouds look like the
pattern of scales on a mackerel fish.
magamp. See magnetic amplifier.
magnesium. A light, silvery-white, malleable, ductile, metallic chemical
element. Magnesium’s symbol is Mg, its atomic number is 12, and its atomic

weight is 24.312. Magnesium burns with an intense white light, and because of
this, it is used for making flares. Magnesium’s light weight makes it useful as a
structural material, but it has disadvantages. It corrodes easily, and vibration
causes it to crack.
Magnesyn. The registered trade name for a remote indicating system, used in
certain aircraft instruments. A Magnesyn transmitter consists of a permanentmagnet rotor, free to rotate inside a toroidal coil. The magnet is rotated by the
physical movement being measured. The indicator contains a small permanent
magnet on a shaft, free to rotate inside a toroidal coil. A pointer is also mounted
on the shaft.
The toroidal coils in the transmitter and indicator are tapped in such a way that
they form delta windings. The cores of these coils are rings of soft iron, and the
two coils are connected in parallel and excited, or powered, with 26-volt, 400hertz alternating current.
The AC alternately saturates and demagnetizes the soft iron cores, so the
magnetic flux from the permanent-magnet rotors is alternately accepted and
rejected by the cores. This changing flux cuts across the windings of the coils
and induces a voltage in them. The relationship between the voltage induced in
each section of the windings is determined by the position of the rotor inside the
transmitter coil. Since the two coils are in parallel, the voltage induced by the
flux from the magnet is the same in both coils, and the small permanent magnet
rotor in the indicator follows the movement of the larger magnet in the
transmitter.
magnet. A piece of material or a device that has the ability to attract pieces of
iron or steel and to generate an electrical voltage in a wire passing near it. A
piece of ferrous metal (metal containing iron) contains billions of tiny magnetic
fields, called magnetic domains. When the metal is not magnetized, these
domains lie in a random fashion, and their fields cancel each other, so the metal
has no overall magnetic field.
But when the metal is magnetized, the domains are aligned so all the north
poles point in one direction, and all the south poles point in the opposite
direction. The metal now has a magnetic field. Invisible lines of magnetic flux
leave the north pole of the magnet and travel by the easiest path to the south
pole. These lines leave and enter the magnet at right angles to the surface. A
magnet attracts pieces of iron or steel (ferrous metals), and if a wire is moved

through the lines of magnetic flux between the poles, electrons are forced to flow
in it.
There are two basic types of magnets: permanent magnets and electromagnets.
Permanent magnets are pieces of metal with the magnetic domains in alignment.
The metal used as a permanent magnet has a high retentivity; therefore it keeps,
or retains, its magnetism.
Electromagnets are made of a coil of wire wound around a core of soft iron.
When direct current flows through the coil, the domains in the soft iron line up,
and the core becomes a strong magnet. Iron has very low retentivity, however,
and as soon as the current stops flowing in the coil, the domains in the iron core
lose their alignment, and the iron is no longer a magnet.
magnetic amplifier (magamp). A type of electrical control transformer in which
a small amount of current flowing in the control winding determines the amount
of load current allowed to flow in the load winding. Direct current flowing
through the bias and control windings of the magamp varies the magnetic
saturation of the core, and the condition of saturation determines the
permeability of the core. Varying the permeability of the core varies the amount
of inductive reactance opposing the AC flowing in the load winding. Magnetic
amplifiers are also called magamps and saturable reactors.
magnetic bearing (navigation). The direction to or from a radio transmitting
station measured relative to magnetic north.
magnetic brake (electric motor component). A type of friction brake that
automatically releases when current flows through the motor windings. As soon
as current to the motor is shut off, a spring forces a stationary friction disk
against a disk that rotates with the motor armature. The friction prevents the
armature turning. An electromagnet pulls the stationary disk away from the
rotating disk when current flows in the motor.
magnetic bubble memory (digital computers). A method of storing information
for use in a digital computer. Tiny areas of magnetism can be formed in a thin
film of magnetic garnet crystal. These tiny areas, or bubbles, can be moved
about within the film to change the logic conditions they represent. Magnetic
bubble memory allows an extremely large amount of digital information to be
stored in an exceedingly small area.
magnetic chuck. A special work surface used with certain types of metalmachining tools. An electromagnetic force holds the material being machined

tightly to the surface.
magnetic circuit. The complete path in an electrical machine that is followed by
lines of magnetic flux. Lines of flux leave the north pole of the magnet, flow
through all the circuit components, and re-enter the magnet at its south pole. In a
motor or generator, the magnetic circuit is made up of the pole shoes, the
armature core, the field frame, and the air gaps between the pole shoes and the
armature.
magnetic circuit breaker. An electrical component that opens a circuit any time
excessive current flows. A magnetic field is produced by current flowing
through the circuit breaker, and the strength of the field is proportional to the
amount of current. When more current flows through the circuit breaker than it is
rated to carry, the magnetic field becomes strong enough to snap open a set of
contacts and break, or open, the circuit.
magnetic compass. An instrument that gives the pilot an indication of the
direction between the aircraft and the earth’s north magnetic pole. The
instrument consists of a pair of small magnets suspended on a pivot and attached
to a compass card that is graduated in 360 degrees clockwise from North. Long
marks are used for each 10° and short marks for each 5°. Every third long mark
is replaced with a number represented the number of degrees from North with
the last digit omitted. The number 3 represents 30°, 12 is 120°, and 33 is 330°.
magnetic compass errors. There are four basic magnetic compass errors;
variation, deviation, turning error, and acceleration error. See variation,
deviation, northerly turning error, and acceleration error.
magnetic course (navigation). A desired flight path referenced from magnetic
north. A true course measured on a navigational chart is referenced to the
geographic north pole but a magnetic compass points to the magnetic north pole.
The angular difference between a true course and a magnetic course is called
variation.
magnetic deviation (navigation). A form of compass error caused by local
magnetic fields in the aircraft interacting with the magnetic field of the earth.
Deviation error is minimized by counteracting the interfering magnetic fields by
adjusting small compensating magnets that are built into the compass housing.
This compensating procedure is called “swinging the compass.” Deviation error
differs with each heading of the aircraft.

magnetic dip. See dip (magnetic compass characteristic).
magnetic-drag tachometer. An instrument used in an aircraft to show the
rotational speed of the engine crankshaft. A flexible shaft, or cable, turned at
one-half crankshaft speed, spins a permanent magnet inside the tachometer.
An aluminum drag cup rides over the spinning magnet, but does not touch it. A
pointer shaft is mounted on the center of the cup, and the tachometer pointer is
pressed onto the end of the shaft. A flat, coiled hairspring attached to the shaft
holds the cup against a stop so the pointer rests on zero when the magnet is not
spinning.
When the engine is running, the magnet spins, and its lines of flux cut across
the aluminum drag cup and generate a voltage in it. This voltage causes eddy
currents to flow in the aluminum cup where they produce a magnetic field. The
magnetic field caused by the eddy currents opposes the field of the spinning
magnet. The faster the magnet spins, the more the cup is pushed against the
restraint of the hairspring.
Most magnetic-drag tachometers incorporate an hourmeter, similar to the
odometer in an automobile speedometer. The hourmeter is a gear-driven counter
which counts the revolutions of the drive shaft and displays the number of hours
the engine has run on the hourmeter wheels. The hours shown are correct only at
a specific RPM, which is normally the cruising speed of the engine. This speed
is stamped on the tachometer case.

magnetic drain plug (engine lubrication system component). A drain plug in the
sump of either a reciprocating engine or a gas turbine engine. Two small
permanent magnets built into the drain plug attract and hold ferrous metal chips

or shavings that may be in the lubricating oil. Metal on the drain plug is an
indication of internal engine failure.
Some magnetic drain plugs in gas turbine engines have the two magnets
connected into an electrical warning system. When bits of metal short across
them, a circuit is completed, and a warning light is turned on to show that metal
particles are loose in the engine.
magnetic field. The invisible, but measurable, force surrounding a permanent
magnet or current-carrying conductor. This field is produced when the orbital
axes of the electrons of the atoms in the material are all in alignment. When a
piece of iron or steel is held in the magnetic field, it is pulled toward the magnet,
and when a conductor passes through a magnetic field, current is induced into it.

magnetic flux. Invisible lines of force passing between the poles of a magnet.
These invisible lines are considered to leave the north pole of a magnet and enter
its south pole, and they always follow the path of least resistance. Lines of flux
form complete loops through the magnet and across the gap between the poles,
and the loops never cross one another. When an electrical conductor cuts across
the lines of magnetic flux, a voltage is produced that causes current to flow in it.
magnetic flux density. The number of lines of magnetic flux per unit of area.
Magnetic flux density is measured in gausses. One gauss is equal to one line of
flux (one maxwell) per square centimeter.
magnetic flux valve. A type of magnetometer using coils of wire as the
transmitting portion of a synchronous repeating system, conventionally used to
stabilize and correct a slaved gyroscopic heading (azimuth) indicator by sensing
changes in the earth’s magnetic field.
magnetic heading (navigation). The direction an aircraft is pointed with respect
to magnetic north. Magnetic north is the direction to the magnetic north pole,

rather than the geographic north pole.
magnetic hysteresis. The characteristic of a magnetic material that causes it to
retain some magnetism after the magnetizing force is removed. In order to
remove all the magnetism from a part, it must be demagnetized with a force
opposite to the one that magnetized it.
Soft iron has very little hysteresis. This means that as soon as a magnetizing
force is removed, iron becomes almost demagnetized. Hard steel, on the other
hand, has a large amount of hysteresis, and a strong force is needed to
demagnetize it.

magnetic north. The earth has the properties of a huge magnet. The magnetic
north pole is the location on the earth’s surface where the lines of magnetic flux
leave, and the magnetic south pole is the point they return. A freely floating
magnet will align with this flux and the north-seeking end will point to the
magnetic north pole. This is magnetic north.
magnetic north pole. The location on the earth near the north geographic pole to
which compass magnets point. The earth is a huge magnet spinning about its
axis in space. Lines of magnetic flux leave the earth at its magnetic north pole
and enter at its magnetic south pole, a location near its south geographic pole.
Magnetic compasses align with this magnetic flux, with one end pointing to the
magnetic north pole.
magnetic particle inspection (nondestructive inspection method). A method of
inspecting ferrous metal components for cracks and other types of flaws. The
part being inspected is magnetized and then flooded with iron oxide suspended
in a light oil much like kerosine. Any flaw, either on the surface or slightly
below the surface, forms a north and a south pole, and the iron oxide attracted to
these poles helps locate the flaw. The iron oxide is often treated with a
fluorescent dye, and the inspection is conducted in a darkened booth. When an

ultraviolet light (black light) is shone on the part, the treated iron oxide shows up
as a brilliant line.
magnetic poles. The locations on a magnet at which the lines of flux leave and
enter. All magnets have both a north pole and a south pole. The lines of flux
leave the magnet at right angles to the face of the north pole and enter at right
angles to the face of the south pole.
magnetic saturation. The condition in which all the magnetic domains in a piece
of magnetized material are lined up in the same direction. When a piece of
unmagnetized iron or other magnetizable material is held in a magnetic field,
increasing the magnetizing force increases the magnetism. But when all the
domains are aligned in the same direction, increasing the magnetizing force no
longer increases the strength of the magnet. The magnet is said to be saturated.
magnetic shunt (electrical measuring instrument component). A piece of soft
iron placed across the air gap in a magnet used in an electrical measuring
instrument to vary the amount of magnetic flux across the gap. The permeability
of soft iron is much higher than that of air (flux can pass through iron much
easier than it can pass through air), and the flux passes through the iron, rather
than crossing the air gap. The position of the magnetic shunt is changed to
calibrate the instrument.
magnetic variation (navigation). A compass error caused by the difference in the
locations of the earth’s geographic north pole and its magnetic north pole. All
navigation charts and maps are drawn with reference to the geographic north
pole, and all magnetic compasses point to the magnetic north pole. These two
locations are not the same, and they are only in alignment along the agonic line.
At any particular location on the surface of the earth, the variation error is the
same for all headings. Variation is called declination in land navigation. See
agonic line, isogonic lines.
magnetic wind direction. The direction from which the wind is blowing as
measured clockwise from magnetic north.
magnetism. A property possessed by certain materials that causes them to attract
or repel other materials having this same property. Magnetism also causes
electrical current to flow in a conductor when it is moved across the lines of
magnetic flux extending out from the magnet.
magnet keeper. A piece of soft iron placed across the poles of a horseshoe

permanent magnet when the magnet is not in use. The permeability of the soft
iron is much greater than that of the air between the poles, and by keeping the
flux concentrated, the flux loss is minimized and the magnet is prevented from
becoming demagnetized.
magneto (reciprocating engine ignition system component). The source of highvoltage electrical energy, used to produce the spark to ignite the fuel-air mixture
inside the cylinders of a reciprocating engine. A magneto contains a small
alternating-current generator with a set of breaker points to interrupt the current
the instant the spark is needed.
Current produced by the AC generator flows through the primary winding of a
step-up transformer, the magneto coil, and this current causes lines of magnetic
flux to expand out across the many turns of wire in the secondary winding of the
coil. When the breaker points open, the primary current immediately stops
flowing, and the magnetic field instantly collapses, cutting across the secondary
winding and producing a high voltage in it. A capacitor, installed across the
breaker points, prevents arcing as the points open.
A magneto also incorporates a distributor, or high-voltage selector switch, to
direct the high voltage to the correct spark plug.
magnetometer. An instrument used to measure and plot the strength and
direction of the earth’s magnetic field. Magnetometers are often towed behind
low-flying airplanes to find deposits of magnetic minerals by noting the change
in the direction of the local magnetic field. These aerial surveys are referred to as
MAD (magnetic anomaly detection) surveys.
magnetomotive force (mmf). A force that produces a magnetic field. The
magnetomotive force caused by current flowing in a coil of wire is determined
by both the amount of current and the number of turns of wire.
The gilbert is the unit of magnetomotive force, with one gilbert being the
amount of mmf needed to cause one maxwell (one line of magnetic flux) to flow
through a magnetic circuit having a reluctance (the opposition to the passage of
magnetic flux) of one unit. One gilbert is also the amount of mmf produced by
0.7957-ampere turn. The constant 0.7957 is 10 divided by four π.
magneto safety check (aircraft reciprocating engine operation check). A check
made by the pilot of an aircraft to determine that the ignition switch is operating
properly. The engine is idled, and the ignition switch is momentarily placed in
the OFF position. The engine should stop firing, but the switch is returned to the

BOTH position before the engine stops turning. This safety check ensures that
both magnetos are grounded when the switch is in the OFF position.
magnetosphere. The outer layer of the earth’s atmosphere. The magnetosphere
starts about a thousand miles above the earth and is the beginning of
interplanetary space. The magnetic field of the earth traps charged particles in
the magnetosphere.
magnetostriction. The characteristic of certain ferromagnetic materials (magnetic
materials containing iron) that causes them to change their physical size when
they are subjected to a magnetic field. Magnetostriction is used in some types of
transducers (devices that change electrical signals into physical movement).
If a bar of magnetostrictive material is used as the core of a coil through which
alternating current is flowing, the changing magnetic field produced by the AC
causes the magnetostrictive bar to change its size enough that it will vibrate an
object attached to it.
magnetron. A special electron tube used to produce high-power electromagnetic
energy in the ultrahigh and superhigh frequency ranges. Magnetron tubes are
used in airborne radar equipment.
magnet wire. The common name for small diameter, varnish-insulated, annealed
copper wire. Magnet wire is used for winding coils for electromagnets,
transformers, motors, and generators.
magnitude of a force. A quantitative measure of the amount of a force.
Magnus effect (fluid mechanics). The lifting force, or pressure differential, that
is produced when air flows over a rotating cylinder or sphere. The Magnus effect
causes a baseball to curve or a golf ball to slice.

the aircraft’s weight.
main landing gear. The landing gear that carries the majority of the weight of an
aircraft on the ground. The main landing gear is usually supported with an
auxiliary nose wheel or tail wheel.
main rotor. 14 CFR Part 1: “The rotor that supplies the principal lift to a
rotorcraft.”

“maintain” (air traffic control). In ATC–pilot communications concerning
altitude/flight level, this term means to remain at the specified altitude/flight
level. The phrase “climb and” or “descend and” normally precedes “maintain”
and the altitude assignment; for example, “descend and maintain 5,000.”
Concerning other ATC instructions, the term is used in its literal sense, e.g.,
“maintain VFR.”
maintenance. The upkeep of equipment. Mechanical and electrical equipment
must be periodically inspected, to be sure it performs as it was designed and
built to perform. When it begins to fail, correct maintenance will usually prevent
the problem becoming major. In addition to inspection, maintenance includes

an aircraft, engine, or component that describes the way maintenance of the
device should be performed. Maintenance manuals for certificated aircraft and
their components are approved by the Federal Aviation Administration and may
be used as approved data when making repairs.
maintenance planning friction level. See friction level classifications.
maintenance release. A release, signed by an authorized inspector or AMT,
signifying that an aircraft has been approved for return to service after certain
maintenance functions have been completed. It is also a statement made by an

normally operates as though it were new.
major repair (aircraft maintenance). 14 CFR Part 1: “A repair:
(1) That, if improperly done, might appreciably affect the weight, balance,
structural strength, performance, powerplant operation, flight characteristics,

Malfunction and Defect Report (M & D Report). A small postcard-like form
used by repair stations, maintenance shops, and technicians to report to the FAA
a defect or unacceptable condition discovered in an FAA-certificated
component. Information gathered on M & D reports allows the FAA to identify
and track weaknesses in certificated products that could create a safety problem.
M & D reports provide the basis for the General Airworthiness Alerts and
subsequent Airworthiness Directives.
malleability. The ability of a material to be stretched or shaped by rolling or
hammering it. Malleable materials do not crack when they are formed in this
way. Gold and lead have a high degree of malleability. Both can be shaped into

machined in a lathe or balanced on a balancing machine.
mandrel (tube bending machine). A long steel rod with a rounded end that is
inserted into a piece of thin-wall metal tubing when it is being bent in a tubebending machine. The rounded end of the rod is held at the point the bend is
started to keep the tubing from flattening as it is bent.

mandrel (propeller balancing component). A precision steel bar on which a

Mn, its atomic number is 25, and its atomic weight is 54.938. Manganese is used
as an alloy for steel to increase its strength, hardness, and wear resistance.
manganese dioxide. A chemical compound used as a depolarizer in carbon-zinc
batteries. Hydrogen gas forms in bubbles on the carbon rod when electrons flow
to it from the zinc can. If these bubbles are allowed to remain on the rod, they
will insulate it from the electrolyte and shut off the flow of electrons. Manganese
dioxide absorbs the hydrogen gas, allowing the electrolyte to remain in contact
with the carbon rod and keep the electrons flowing.
Manganin. The registered trade name for an alloy of copper, manganese, and
nickel. Manganin is used for wire-wound resistors because its resistance changes
very little as its temperature changes.
manifold absolute pressure. See MAP.
manifold (hydraulic system component). The portions of an aircraft hydraulic
system to which the selector valves are connected. Selector valves receive
pressurized fluid from the pressure manifold and route return fluid from the
actuators to the return manifold and then to the reservoir.
manifold (reciprocating engine exhaust system component). A chamber
connected to the exhaust ports on the cylinders of an engine. All the cylinders

empty their exhaust gases into the manifold from which they are carried
overboard through the muffler and tail pipe.
manifold cross-feed fuel system. A type of fuel system commonly used in large
transport-category aircraft. All fuel tanks feed into a common manifold, and the
dump chutes and the single-point fueling valves are connected to the manifold.
Fuel lines to each engine are taken from the manifold.
manifold pressure. 14 CFR Part 1: “Absolute pressure as measured at the
appropriate point in the induction system and usually expressed in inches of
mercury.”
manifold pressure gage. A pressure gage that measures the absolute pressure
inside the induction system of a reciprocating engine. When the engine is not
operating, this instrument shows the existing atmospheric pressure.

manifold valve. See flow divider.
manometer. An instrument used to measure low values of air pressure. A
manometer consists of a long glass tube mounted in front of a calibrated scale.
The tube is filled with a liquid, and air pressure forces the liquid up in the tube
where its height is measured against the scale.
Different ranges of pressure can be measured by using different liquids: water
is used for low pressure, ethylene dibromide for medium pressure, and mercury
for higher pressure. Differential pressure can be measured by forming the tube
into the shape of the letter U and applying the two pressures to the two ends of
the tube.

man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS). Lightweight, shoulderlaunched missile weapon systems designed for the purpose of bringing down
aircraft or attacking ground targets. Although these weapons have limited range
and their accuracy is affected by poor visibility and adverse weather, they can be
used anywhere on land or sea where there is unrestricted visibility to the target
and as such are a potential threat to airborne aircraft.
manual depressurization valve (aircraft pressurization system component). A
manual back-up for the automatic cabin pressure outflow valve. If the automatic
outflow valve should malfunction, the cabin pressure can be controlled with the
manual depressurization valve.
manufactured rivet head. The head of a rivet that was formed when the rivet was

and usable products. An aircraft is manufactured when the raw aluminum, iron,
copper, and organic chemicals are changed into the finished product.
MAP (manifold absolute pressure). The absolute pressure of the fuel/air mixture
inside the induction system of a reciprocating engine, usually measured in inches
of mercury. The manifold pressure of a nonsupercharged engine can never be
higher than the pressure of the surrounding air, but supercharging can increase
the manifold pressure above that of the atmosphere.

MAP (missed approach point) (air traffic control). A point prescribed in each
instrument approach at which a missed approach procedure shall be executed if
the required visual reference does not exist.
Marconi antenna (radio antenna). A quarter-wavelength, vertically polarized
antenna, normally used for transmitting and receiving radio communications in
the higher frequency bands. Aircraft communications in the very-high-frequency
(VHF) band normally uses a Marconi antenna whose length is one fourth of the
wavelength of the center frequency to be transmitted.
One conductor from the transmitter is connected to the quarter-wave antenna,
and the other conductor is connected to the metal structure of the aircraft on
which the antenna is mounted. This metal structure serves as a quarterwavelength reflector. A Marconi antenna is nondirectional (it radiates its signal
equally well in all directions).
mare’s tail (meteorology). A cirrus cloud with a curve on one end and a long
flowing tail on the other.
marginal VFR (MVFR). Weather conditions with a ceiling of 1,000 to 3,000 feet
and/or visibility 3 to 5 miles inclusive.
margin identification. The top and bottom areas on an instrument approach chart
that depict information about the procedure, including airport location and
procedure identification.
marine grommet (aircraft fabric covering component). A small plastic or metal
reinforcing ring attached to the fabric covering at low points in the structure and
at the trailing edges of the wing and tail surfaces. Grommets are used to
reinforce the drain or vent holes cut in the fabric at these locations. A marine
grommet, also called a seaplane grommet, differs from ordinary grommets
because of a shield placed over the hole. This shield keeps the spray during
takeoff and landing from getting into the structure.
marker beacon (radio navigation equipment). A low-powered, 75-MHz, fixedfrequency radio transmitter that directs its signal vertically upward in a small,
fan-shaped pattern. Marker beacons are located along the flight path used when
approaching an airport for landing, and are identified by their modulation
frequency and keying code. When received by compatible airborne equipment,
marker beacons indicate to the pilot, both aurally and visually, when the aircraft
is directly over the facility.

When the aircraft is directly above the outer marker the pilot hears a series of
400-hertz dashes and the blue light illuminates in the series of dashes. Over the
middle marker, the amber light illuminates in a series of alternate dots and
dashes and the aural tone is a series of 1,300-hertz dots and dashes. The inner
marker is identified by the white light illuminating in a series of dots and a series
of 3,000-hertz dots is heard by the pilot.

married needles (helicopter operation). The needles (pointers) of a dual
tachometer indicator installed in a helicopter are said to “married” when one
needle is exactly on top of the other. One needle is driven by a tachometer
generator on the engine and the other by a generator on the transmission that
senses the speed of the rotor. When the rotor-drive clutch is fully engaged and
there is no slippage, the needles are married.
Martin clip (fabric covering component). A patented wire clip used to attach
aircraft fabric to the wing ribs. A Martin clip is long piece of spring steel wire
with a series of hooks bent into it at each location the fabric should be attached
to the rib cap strip. The hooks are pressed through small slits in the reinforcing
tape and the fabric and through elongated holes in the rib cap strips. The hooks
lock the clip in the holes and pull the fabric tight against the cap strip. The use of
Martin clips rather than rib stitching saves a tremendous amount of time when
covering an aircraft surface.

masking material (aircraft finishing). Masks are used to prevent the finishing
materials coming into contact with a surface. Masks are made of such materials

as thin metal, fiberboard, paper, or masking tape.
masking tape. Paper tape with a pressure-sensitive adhesive on one side.
Masking tape has a wrinkled texture so it will lie smoothly around a curve, and
the adhesive is easily removed from a properly prepared surface. Masking tape is
used to fasten paper to parts of a surface being painted, to prevent the paint from
reaching certain areas.
Masonite. The registered trade name for a type of fiberboard. Masonite is made
by exploding wood chips in a steam gun to break them into long, individual
fibers. These fibers are bonded together with lignin (a natural adhesive in the
original wood) to make a smooth, grainless sheet of material that can be used for
insulation, partitions, etc.
mass. The amount of matter, or material, in an object. To find the mass of an
object, divide its weight, in pounds, by 32.2. The constant, 32.2, is derived from
the fact that a freely falling object is accelerated by the force of gravity 32.2 feet
per second each second it falls.
Mass = Weight / 32.2
mass flow rate. The product of fluid density and its linear velocity. The symbol
for mass flow rate is the letter G.
massive-electrode spark plug. A type of spark plug used in aircraft reciprocating
engines. A massive-electrode spark plug has three or four nickel-alloy ground
electrodes surrounding the insulated center electrode. Massive-electrode spark
plugs provide reliable ignition under normal operating conditions, but are
replaced with fine-wire spark plugs in conditions where lead fouling is a
problem.

mass production. A method of producing large numbers of identical objects by
the use of specialized jigs and fixtures. In the process of mass production, the
manufacturing procedure is broken down into small steps that can be performed
by automatic machinery or that can be done quickly and repeatedly by unskilled
workers. Mass production of interchangeable parts has made the manufacture of
complex equipment possible and economical.

mast bumping (rotorcraft). The action of an underslung rotor head when it
strikes the mast.
master cylinder (hydraulic brake system component). The cylinder in an aircraft
hydraulic brake system whose piston is moved by the pilot. When the piston is
pressed into the master cylinder, hydraulic fluid is forced into the wheel
cylinder, applying the brake.
master rod (radial reciprocating engine component). The only rod in a radial
engine that connects a piston directly to the crankshaft. The crankshaft of a
radial engine has only one throw for each row of cylinders, and the large end of
the master rod rides on the journal of this throw. The small end of the master rod
is connected through a wrist pin to one piston. The pistons in all the other
cylinders in that row attach to link rods (articulated rods) that connect to the
master rod through knuckle pins.

master switch (aircraft electrical system). A single switch that controls electrical
power to all the circuits in an aircraft electrical system. When the master switch
(a form of safety switch) is off, no circuit can be energized.

master tank (hot-air balloon). The propane tank, usually tank number one, that
offers all appropriate services, such as liquid, vapor, and backup system.

turns ratio between its coils that matches the impedance of the load to the
impedance of the source of electrical power. The impedance of the primary
winding of the transformer is the same as the output impedance of the source,
and the impedance of its secondary winding is the same as the impedance of the
load. The maximum amount of power can be transferred in an electrical circuit
when the impedance of the source matches the impedance of the load.

criteria and can be found on the type certificate data sheet for that particular
balloon.
maximum allowable takeoff power. The maximum power an engine is allowed
to develop for a limited period of time; usually about one minute. For example,
especially in the case of go-arounds, the instant the pilot decides to go around,
full or maximum allowable takeoff power must be applied smoothly and without
hesitation, and held until flying speed and controllability are restored.
maximum allowable zero-fuel weight (aircraft specification). The maximum
weight authorized for an aircraft that does not include the weight of the fuel.

maximum altitude. An altitude depicted on an instrument approach chart with an
overscored altitude value, at or below which aircraft are required to maintain
altitude.

or route segment. It is the highest altitude on a Federal airway, jet route, area
navigation low or high route, or other direct route for which an MEA is
designated in 14 CFR Part 95, at which adequate reception of navigation aid
signals is assured.
maximum engine overtorque. The maximum torque of the free power turbine
rotor assembly, the inadvertent occurrence of which, for periods of up to 20
seconds, will not require rejection of the engine from service or any maintenance
action other than to correct the cause. This applies to turbopropeller and
turboshaft engines incorporating free power turbines for all ratings except oneengine-inoperative (OEI) ratings of two minutes or less.
maximum landing weight (aircraft specification). The greatest weight an aircraft
is allowed to have when it lands. A takeoff places much less strain on an aircraft
structure than a landing, and many aircraft that fly for long distances are allowed
to takeoff with a greater weight than they are allowed to have for landing. If an
aircraft leaves with its maximum takeoff weight and must return for landing
before it has burned off enough fuel to get down to its allowable landing weight,
it must be able to dump part of its fuel load.
maximum payload capacity. For an aircraft for which a maximum zero fuel
weight is prescribed in FAA technical specifications, this is the maximum zero
fuel weight when subtracting empty weight, all justifiable aircraft equipment,
and the operating load (minimum flightcrew, foods and beverages, and supplies
and equipment related to foods and beverages, but not including disposable fuel
or oil). For all other aircraft, maximum payload capacity is the maximum
certificated takeoff weight of the aircraft, minus the empty weight, all justifiable
aircraft equipment, and operating load (minimum fuel load, oil, and flightcrew).
Details regarding the allowance for the weight of the crew, oil, and fuel are
found in 14 CFR §110.2.
maximum ramp weight (GAMA). Maximum weight approved for ground
maneuver. It includes weight of start, taxi, and runup fuel.

maximum takeoff weight (aircraft specification). The maximum allowable
weight at the start of the takeoff run. The aircraft may be initially loaded to a
greater weight to allow for fuel burnoff during ground operation. The takeoff
weight for a particular flight may be limited to a lesser weight when runway
length, atmospheric conditions, or other variables are adverse.
maximum taxi weight. Maximum weight approved for ground maneuvers. This
is the same as maximum ramp weight.
maximum weight (aircraft specification). The maximum authorized weight of
the aircraft and all of its equipment as specified in the TCDS (Type Certificate
Data Sheets) for the aircraft.
maximum wind axis (meteorology). A line on a constant-pressure chart which
denotes the axis of maximum wind speeds at that constant-pressure surface.
maximum zero fuel weight. The maximum authorized weight of an aircraft
without fuel. This is the sum of the basic operating weight, BOW, and the
payload.

magnetic flux. One maxwell gives a magnetic induction of one gauss per square
centimeter.
mayday. The international call for help, used with voice radio transmission. The
term “mayday” comes from the French word m’aidez (help me), pronounced
“mayday” in English. Mayday is used in voice transmission in the same way the
letters SOS are used in code transmission.
MB. See magnetic bearing.
MCA (minimum crossing altitude). The lowest altitude at certain fixes at which
an aircraft must cross when proceeding in the direction of a higher minimum en
route IFR altitude (MEA).
MCW (modulated continuous wave). A type of radio code transmission in which
the carrier wave is modulated with a continuous audio-frequency tone. Code is
sent by transmitting the modulated carrier in short and long pulses, or bursts.
The short pulses are called dots, and the long pulses are called dashes.
Modulated continuous wave code differs from continuous wave (CW) code in

that a beat-frequency oscillator is not needed in the receiver for MCW to be
heard.
MDA (minimum descent altitude). 14 CFR Part 1: “The lowest altitude,
expressed in feet above mean sea level, to which descent is authorized on final
approach or during circle-to-land maneuvering in execution of a standard
instrument approach procedure, where no electronic glide slope is provided.”
MEA (minimum enroute IFR altitude). The lowest published altitude between
radio fixes which ensures acceptable navigational signal coverage and meets
obstacle clearance requirements between those fixes. The MEA prescribed for a
federal airway or segment thereof, area navigation low or high route, or other
direct route applies to the entire width of the airway, segment, or route between
the radio fixes defining that airway, segment, or route.
mean. A term used for the middle-point, or median. Mean sea level is the
midpoint between the highest and lowest level of the sea. Mean values are used
when measuring from a reference that moves, or changes, between specific
limits.

of an airfoil section. The mean camber determines the aerodynamic
characteristics of the airfoil.

mean sea level. See MSL.

sample reading every second over the last two minutes.

measured ceiling (meteorology). A ceiling classification applied when the
ceiling value has been determined by instruments or the known heights of
unobscured portions of objects other than natural landmarks.
mechanic. A person skilled in repairing mechanical devices. The Federal
Aviation Administration issues a license for aircraft mechanics with two ratings
applicable: airframe and powerplant. See A & P mechanic and AMT (Aviation
Maintenance Technician).
mechanical advantage. The increase in force or speed produced by a mechanical
device, such as the lever, pulley, gears, or hydraulic cylinder. These devices
increase speed or force, but they cannot produce work. The force needed to lift a
weight may be reduced, or the speed at which an object moves may be changed.
But if mechanical losses are discounted, the amount of work (force times
distance) taken from the device is the same as the amount of work put into it.
mechanical blockage thrust reverser (gas turbine engine component). A type of
thrust reverser that uses a pair of clamshell doors set into the tail cone of the
engine to deflect the exhaust gases forward when the pilot wants to slow the
aircraft.

to measure the resistance. Meggers are used to measure insulation resistance and
the resistance between components and electrical ground.
megohmmeter. An instrument used to measure very high values of resistance
such as found in materials normally considered to be insulators. Megohmmeters
use a high voltage to force current through the material and a sensitive indicator
to measure the extremely small current that results.

in water and is used as a solvent for vinyl and nitrocellulose films. MEK is an
efficient solvent for removing oily contaminants from ignition system
components and for cleaning and preparing surfaces for priming or painting.
MEK’s chemical formula is CH3COC2H5.

liquid because of the heat it has absorbed.
memory (in learning process). The ability of people and other organisms to store
and use information, consisting of three main stages: encoding (initial perception
and registration of information), storage (retention of encoded information over
time), and retrieval (processes involved in using stored information).
mendelevium. A radioactive chemical element in the actinide series.
Mendelevium’s symbol is Md, and its atomic number is 101. Mendelevium is
made by bombarding lighter elements with light nuclei accelerated in cyclotrons.
meniscus. The shape of the top of a column of liquid caused by surface tension.
Water wets the inside of a glass tube, and capillary action pulls the water up the
sides of the tube. Surface tension causes the meniscus of water to be concave.
Mercury does not wet the glass, so surface tension causes mercury to have a
convex meniscus.
When reading a barometer or manometer using a column of liquid in front of a
calibrated scale, read the height of the column at a point tangent to the meniscus
rather than from the edge of the liquid on the glass.
meniscus lens (optics). A simple lens having one concave and one convex side.
If the convex side has a longer focal length than the concave side, the lens is a
diverging lens. But if the concave side has the longer focal length, the lens is a
converging lens.
mensuration. The act of measuring or computing lengths, areas, volumes, and
angles of various geometric shapes or quantities.
Mercator projection (navigation). The projection used for map making in which
the meridians of longitude and parallels of latitude are straight, parallel lines.
The distance between each meridian of longitude is the same, but the parallels of
latitude are close together near the equator and become increasingly farther apart
as they near the poles. The shape and size of land masses near the poles are
greatly distorted on a map drawn on a Mercator projection.
mercerize. A treatment given to cotton thread to make it strong and lustrous. The
thread is stretched while it is soaked in a solution of caustic soda. Mercerized

thread has a sheen similar to silk, it is stronger and more pliable than untreated
thread, and it accepts dye more readily.
mercury. A silvery-white, poisonous, metallic chemical element that is liquid at
room temperature. Mercury’s symbol is Hg, its atomic number is 80, and its
atomic weight is 200.59. Mercury is heavy (more than 13 times as heavy as
water), is a good conductor of electricity, and readily unites with other chemical
elements. It is used in thermometers to measure temperature by the amount it
expands or contracts as temperature changes. It is also used in barometers to
determine the pressure of the atmosphere by measuring the height of the column
of mercury the atmospheric pressure supports.
mercury barometer. An instrument used to measure atmospheric pressure. A
glass tube about one meter long, with one end closed and the other end open, is
filled with mercury, and the open end is submerged in a bowl, or cistern, of
mercury. The mercury in the tube will drop down, leaving a vacuum above the
mercury in the closed end.
Atmospheric pressure pressing down on the mercury in the bowl holds the
mercury up inside the tube. The height of the top of the mercury in the tube
above the level of the mercury in the bowl is an accurate measure of the amount
of pressure produced by the weight of the atmosphere. Standard atmospheric
pressure at sea level holds the mercury up in the tube to a height of 760
millimeters, or 29.92 inches.

mercury cell (electrical battery). A type of primary electrical cell (a cell that
cannot be recharged). A mercury cell uses zinc for its anode (positive terminal),
mercuric oxide for the cathode (negative terminal), and potassium hydroxide for
the electrolyte. A mercury cell has a longer life than either an alkaline cell or a
carbon-zinc cell, and its low internal resistance allows it to hold a constant
output voltage until it is almost completely discharged.
mercury oxide cell. A nonrechargeable electrochemical battery, a primary cell.
The anode material is pure powdered zinc and the cathode material is mercuric
oxide. The electrolyte is a paste of potassium hydroxide in water. The case of the
mercury oxide battery is nickel plated and acts as the positive terminal, or
cathode, of the cell.
mercury switch. A form of electrical switch using mercury in a glass tube as a
conductor. Two wires are brought into the glass tube in such a way that they are
near each other, but do not touch. When the tube is tilted in such a way that
mercury sealed in the tube covers the ends of the two wires, the switch is closed
and current flows through the mercury. When the tube is tilted in the opposite
direction, the mercury moves away from the wires, the switch is open, and no
current flows.
mercury thermometer. A form of liquid thermometer. A glass tube having an
extremely small inside diameter is attached to a small reservoir completely filled
with mercury. The volume of mercury in the reservoir is determined by its
temperature. As the mercury absorbs heat, it expands and rises inside the tube. A
temperature scale is marked alongside the tube, and, since the height of the
mercury in the tube relates to the temperature of the mercury in the reservoir, the
level of the top of the column of mercury can be marked to indicate the
temperature.
mercury vapor lamp. A form of electric-arc lamp. An arc is formed inside a
transparent tube between two electrodes in an atmosphere of mercury vapor.
Mercury-vapor lamps produce a bluish-green light containing a large amount of
ultraviolet radiation.
mercury vapor rectifier (electrical component). A type of electrical component,
used to change alternating current into direct current. Drops of liquid mercury
inside an evacuated glass tube are changed into mercury vapor by heat from a
built-in filament. Mercury vapor can be ionized by a low voltage of one polarity,
but it must have an extremely high voltage of the opposite polarity to ionize it.

This makes it a good rectifier. Mercury rectifiers have a small voltage drop
across them when they are conducting, and they are efficient conductors of large
amounts of current in high-voltage circuits.
meridian (navigation). An imaginary great circle on the surface of the earth that
passes through the North and South geographic poles. The reference, or prime,

grouping of thunderstorms. Individual thunderstorms within the MCS may be
severe.
mesosphere. The portion of the earth’s atmosphere extending from about 45 to
55 kilometers (28 to 34 miles) up to about 80 to 95 kilometers (50 to 59 miles).
The mesosphere begins at the top of the stratosphere, and in the mesosphere, the
temperature generally decreases with altitude.
metal. A fusible, ductile, lustrous material. Fusible means it can be melted,
ductile means its shape can be changed by drawing or stretching, and lustrous
means it reflects light evenly without sparkling. Nearly all metals are good
conductors of electricity and heat, and all metals readily lose electrons to form
positive ions.
metal fatigue. The progressive, localized, and permanent structural damage that
occurs within a metal when it is subjected to repeated cyclic or fluctuating
strains. The stresses causing these strains may be much less than the static yield
strength of the material.
metal-film resistor (electrical component). A type of electrical resistor made by

depositing an extremely thin film of metal on a ceramic form. The thickness and
type of metal film determines the resistance and the power-dissipating ability of
the resistor.
metal foil (electrical capacitor component). A very thin sheet of metal used as an
electrode in electrolytic capacitors. The use of foil allows a large-area electrode
to be contained in a small physical space.
metal-ion concentration-cell corrosion. A type of concentration-cell corrosion
that forms in the metal skin of an aircraft along the edges of a lap joint where
moisture can be trapped. When trapped water absorbs oxygen from the air, it
attracts electrons from the metal and forms negative hydroxide ions. When
electrons are taken from the metal, positive metallic ions are left, and these
positive ions collect in the stagnant moisture trapped between the skins in the lap
joint. The positive ions attract electrons from the metal along the edges of the lap
joint and cause the metal to unite with the hydroxide ions in the moisture to form
a salt. This salt is corrosion.
metallic pigment. Thin flakes of aluminum or copper that are mixed with a liquid
vehicle to serve as the pigment for paint. When the paint is applied to a surface,
these tiny flakes spread out to form a solid, opaque covering.
metallic ring test (test for bonded-structure delamination). A very simple test for
delamination in a bonded structural component. The material is tapped with a
coin, and the sound is noted. If the sound is a clear metallic ringing, the material
is good, and there is no delamination. But if the tapping produces a dull thudding
noise, there is a good possibility that the laminations of which the material is
made have begun to separate.
metallizing. (1) The application of molten metal onto the surface of any solid
base material by spraying or by vacuum evaporation. (2) The replacing of fabric
covering of an airplane structure with thin sheet metal.
metallurgy. The area of materials science and engineering that relates to the
physical and chemical behavior of metallic elements, their intermetallic
compounds and their mixtures, or alloys.
metal oxide rectifier. A form of electrical rectifier that operates on the principle
that electrons can flow from a base metal through a film of oxide, but cannot
flow through the oxide into the base metal. Copper oxide and selenium oxide

rectifiers have both been used in the past, but they have been replaced, to a great
extent, by silicon or germanium semiconductor diode rectifiers.
metal oxide semiconductor capacitor. See MOS capacitor.
metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor. See MOSFET.
metal spinning. A method of forming sheet metal. A disk of metal is clamped in
a lathe in front of a male die whose shape is that of the inside of the part to be
spun. The lathe is turned at a high speed, and the metal is forced against the die
with a wooden tool.
metal spraying. A method of covering a material with a coating of metal. The
metal to be used for the coating is melted and sprayed out with hot, high-velocity
compressed air. Metal spraying is used to cover a steel part with aluminum to
prevent corrosion, and it can also be used to cover a nonconductive material,
such as wood or paper, with metal to make it electrically conductive.

weather reported in a standard international format.
metastable compound. A chemical compound that is stable under some
conditions, but unstable under others.
meteor. A small particle of solar matter that is visible only as it becomes
incandescent (glows because of its extremely high temperature). The high
temperature is caused by friction as the meteor falls through the earth’s
atmosphere. Meteors are made of metal or rock or a combination of metal and
rock. They are often called “shooting stars” or “falling stars,” and millions of
burned-out particles of meteors fall on the earth each day as dust.
meteorological impact statement (air traffic control). See MIS.

subcategories of prevailing visibility and runway visibility. Meteorological
visibility is a measure of horizontal visibility near the earth’s surface, based on

Normally, this fix should be established at a distance from the airport which will
facilitate a profile descent 10,000 feet above airport elevation or above.
metering jet. A precision orifice used to restrict the flow of a fluid. The diameter
and length of the orifice, and the approach and departure angles to and from the
orifice, all determine the amount of fluid that can flow under a given pressure
drop across the orifice. See illustration for calibrated orifice.
metering pin. A flow control device in a metering orifice, used to vary the
amount of fluid that can flow through it. The area of the orifice with the pin fully
in it determines the minimum amount of fluid that can flow, and the area of the
jet with the pin all the way out determines the maximum amount of flow. The

shape, or contour, of the metering pin determines the amount of fluid that can
flow with the pin in any position other than full in or full out.
metering position(s) (air traffic control). Controller plan view displays and main
display monitors, and associated “D” positions, which have been adapted for
display of a metering position list. A maximum of four plan view displays

controls the number of minutes prior to the flight plan calculated time of arrival
at the meter fix for each aircraft that the “tentative calculated landing time
(TCLT)” is frozen and becomes an “actual calculated landing time (ACLT).” In
this ATC computer process, the vertex time of arrival (VTA) is updated and
consequently the TCLT is modified as appropriate until frozen, at which time
updating is suspended and an ACLT is assigned. When frozen, the flight entry is
inserted into the arrival sector’s meter list for display on the sector plan view
display (PVD) or main display monitor. MLDI is used if the filed true airspeed is
less than or equal to the freeze speed parameters (FSPD).
methanol (wood alcohol). A poisonous liquid alcohol, formed by the distillation
of wood pulp. Methanol is used as a fuel, a solvent, and an antifreeze agent.
methylene chloride. A chemical compound, CH2Cl2, that has a very high
volatility and the ability to dissolve a wide range of organic compounds. It is
used as the volatile agent in pressure type oil temperature indicators and as

its potential risk of causing cancer, and of its adverse effects on the heart, central
nervous system and liver.

METO power (maximum except takeoff power). A rating for aircraft

mindset (in aeronautical decision making). The pilot’s current inclination or
intention affects his or her decision making in flying, and preconceived ideas can
influence the outcome of events. For example, having a mindset to expect
improving weather conditions can lead to increased risk-taking regarding a
flight. This is due to an inability to recognize and cope with changes in the
situation that are different from those anticipated or planned, such as not
noticing deteriorating weather or conditions that warrant a new course.
Therefore the pilot should be aware of having any set notions or attitudes about
conditions before planning a flight, because just as physical fatigue and illness
will directly affect judgment, so too will attitude management, stress
management, risk management, personality tendencies, and situational
awareness.

minicomputer (digital computer). A small- to medium-size digital computer.

fuel which could be used in weight and balance computations when low fuel
might adversely affect the most critical balance conditions. To determine the
weight of the minimum fuel in pounds, divide the METO horsepower by 2.
When computing the adverse loaded center of gravity conditions of an aircraft, if
the fuel pulls the center of gravity into the correct range, the minimum fuel must
be used.
minimum holding altitude. See MHA.

not fluctuate with altitude. See also miles-in-trail (MIT).
mirror image. A duplicate of an object which is like the original object in all
ways except that one side is the reverse of the other: the left side is on the right,
and the right side is on the left. This term is taken from the image we see formed
in a mirror. When we face a mirror, the image we see has its right side on the left
and its left side on the right.

the air. The droplets making up the atmospheric condition we call mist are larger
than the droplets making up haze and smaller than those making up fog.
mist coat. A very light coat of metal primer. A mist coat is so thin that the metal
is still visible, but the primer makes pencil marks easy to see.
miter (woodworking). To cut the edges of boards or surfaces in such a way that
they match, or fit together.
miter box. A device that holds a piece of wood and a saw, so the saw can cut the

mixer, the mixer output will contain four signals: Signals having the two original
frequencies, a signal whose frequency is the sum of the two original frequencies,
and one whose frequency is the difference between the two original frequencies.
The output of the mixer is directed into a filter circuit which selects the
difference frequency for use in subsequent stages as the intermediate frequency,
or IF.
mixing ratio (meteorology). The ratio by weight of the amount of water vapor in
a volume of air to the amount of dry air. Mixing ratio is usually expressed as
grams per kilogram (g/kg).
mixture. A combination of substances held together by physical rather than
chemical means. The constituents of a mixture retain all their own chemical
properties and mixtures do not have to be combined in definite proportions, as is
required for chemical compounds. Sweetened tea is a mixture of tea and sugar,
and concrete is a mixture of sand, gravel, and cement.
mixture control (reciprocating engine control). A control installed in a
reciprocating-engine-powered aircraft that allows the pilot to vary the fuel-air
mixture ratio while the engine is running.
A reciprocating engine requires the proper amount of fuel to be mixed with the
air on the basis of the weight of the air. But most fuel-metering systems measure
the fuel on the basis of the volume, not the weight, of the air entering the engine.
The density (weight per unit volume) of the air decreases as the aircraft goes up

in altitude, and the pilot must be able to decrease the amount of fuel metered into
the less dense air. This adjustment is made with the mixture control.
MLS (microwave landing system). An instrument landing system operating in
the microwave spectrum which provides lateral and vertical guidance to aircraft
having compatible avionics equipment. An MLS approach procedure provides
for an approach to a height above touchdown (HAT) of not less than 200 feet
and a runway visual range (RVR) of not less than 1,800 feet. It is categorized as
MLS Category I, II, or III depending on the installation and equipment
associated with the specific procedure.

within a semiconductor material. Holes are positive mobile charges, and they
drift within the material toward a negative electrical charge. Electrons are
negative mobile charges, and they drift within the material toward a positive
electrical charge.

published altitude in effect between radio fixes on VOR airways, off-airway
routes, or route segments which meets obstacle clearance requirements for the
entire route segment and which assures acceptable navigational signal coverage
only within 25 statute (22 nautical) miles of a VOR.

mock-up. A full-sized imitation of a real device. Mock-ups of complex and
costly devices, such as aircraft and space vehicles, are built to assure that all the
different systems and components will work properly when they are installed in
the actual vehicle. Mock-ups can also be a portion of a complete device used as a
training aid. In this regard, the control system and instruments of an aircraft or
spacecraft can be made into a mock-up, so flight crews can be trained before the
actual vehicle is ready for flight.

encoding altimeter is installed, Mode C will transmit the aircraft altitude to the
ground radar facility.
mode C intruder alert (air traffic control). A function of certain air traffic control
automatic systems designed to alert radar controllers to existing or pending

the aircraft; and flown for hobby or recreational purposes.”
modem. A MOdulator-DEModulator used to connect two computers by way of
telephone lines. Digital information from one computer is changed into tones for
transmission over the phone lines. This is the function of the modulator. At the

receiver end, the tones are changed back into digital information for the other
computer to process. This is called demodulation.

a facility in which specialists using sophisticated equipment can isolate the
problem and fix it. Modern turbine engines and most sophisticated electronic
equipment are made to allow for modular maintenance.
modular structure. A structure built in standard units, or modules.
modulate (radio communications). In radio communications, to modulate means
to change some characteristic, such as amplitude, frequency, or phase of an
alternating current wave. A radio-frequency (RF) wave having a constant
amplitude can be amplitude modulated (AM) by an audio-frequency (AF)
voltage changing the amplitude of the RF wave in the same way the amplitude of
the AF signal varies. The changes in voltage of the modulated RF wave can be
used to produce a varying AF voltage. This process is called demodulation.

slight angle over a print of the same size lines with the same spacing.
moist adiabatic lapse rate (meteorology). See saturated-adiabatic lapse rate.
moisture. Water contained in a mass of air. The water may be in the form of
vapor, or it may be tiny droplets of haze, mist, or fog.
moisture separator (pneumatic system component). A component in a highpressure pneumatic system that removes most of the water vapor from the
compressed air. When the compressed air is used, its pressure is dropped, and
this pressure drop causes a drop in temperature. If any moisture were allowed to
remain in the air, it would freeze and block the system. The separation is
normally done by centrifugal action of the air that slings the moisture out into an
area where it can be collected and drained when the system is shut down.
mold line (sheet metal layout). A line used in the development of a flat pattern
for a formed piece of sheet metal. The mold line is an extension of the flat side
of a part beyond the radius. The mold line dimension of a part is the dimension
made to the intersection of mold lines and is the dimension the part would have
if its corners had no radius.

mold point. The intersection of two mold lines of a part. Mold line dimensions
are made between mold points.
mold release agent. A lubricant used to coat a mold in which plastic resin is
formed. Resin does not stick to the release agent, and the part can be taken from

moment arm (physics). The distance from a fulcrum to the applied force.
moment index (weight and balance). A moment divided by a constant, such as
10, 100, 1,000, or an even larger number. The use of a moment index allows
weight and balance computations to be made using smaller numbers, and this
decreases the chance for errors.
moment index envelope (weight and balance). A graphical representation of the
forward and aft CG limits of an airplane using weight and moment indexes. If a
horizontal line representing the weight of the aircraft and a vertical line
representing its total moment index (the moment divided by a reduction factor)
intersect within the envelope, the aircraft weight and balance conditions are
within allowable limits.
moment limits vs. weight envelope. An enclosed area on a graph of three
parameters. If the intersection of the diagonal line representing the moment/100
crosses the horizontal line, representing the weight, at the vertical line

representing the CG location, in inches aft of the datum falls within the
envelope, the aircraft is loaded within its weight and CG limits.
moment of inertia (rotational inertia). A measurement related to torque that
concerns to the ease or difficulty of starting or stopping the rotation of an object.
The moment of inertia of an object is the sum of all the masses making up the
object multiplied by the square of the distance of each mass from the axis of

circumstances, monitoring does not establish communications.
monitor alert (MA) (air traffic control). A function of the traffic flow
management system (TFMS) that provides traffic management personnel with a
tool for predicting potential capacity problems in individual operational sectors.
The MA indicates that traffic management personnel need to analyze a particular
sector for actual activity and determine the required action(s), if any, needed to
control the demand. A monitor alert parameter (MAP) is designated for each
operational sector in increments of 15 minutes, to aid in processing the MAs.
monkey wrench. A common name for a form of adjustable wrench. A monkey

into a structure that resembles an eggshell. There is a minimum of structure
inside a monocoque skin.
monolithic casting. A type of casting in which the object is cast or formed as a
single piece. A large and complex object cast with one pouring of the molten
metal into a mold is a monolithic casting. Monolithic castings have no seams or
joints.
monoplane (type of airplane). An airplane having only one main supporting
wing. Up through the 1920s, most airplanes were biplanes (airplanes having two
wings) because of the ease of bracing. But as engineering knowledge increased,
engineers were able to make monoplanes of sufficient strength. The lower drag
of a monoplane makes it more efficient than a biplane.

this condition, but a special signal can cause it to shift to the other. As soon as
the signal is removed, it automatically returns to its first condition.
monsoon (meteorology). A wind that in summer blows from the sea to a
continental interior, bringing copious amounts of rain. In the winter this wind
blows from the interior to the sea, resulting in sustained dry weather.
moor. To secure or tie the seaplane to a dock, buoy, or other stationary object on

from multiple radar or ADS-B sites. Targets are displayed from a single source
within a radar sort box according to the hierarchy of the sources assigned.
MOS capacitor (metal oxide semiconductor capacitor). A capacitor that uses a
semiconductor material as one plate, a thin film of silicon oxide as the dielectric,
and a tiny spot of metal plated on the oxide as the other plate. MOS capacitors
used as temporary storage devices in a digital computer are called dynamic
RAMs (random access memories).
MOSFET (metal-oxide silicon field-effect transistor). A semiconductor device
that consists of P-type source and drain regions diffused into a substrate of Ntype silicon. A substrate is the supporting material on which an integrated circuit
chip is built. The source and drain are on either side of a narrow channel of Nmaterial, and an insulating layer of silicon oxide is deposited over the substrate
so it covers the source, the drain, and the channel between them. A gate
connection is formed between the source and the drain, and it is insulated from
them by the oxide film.
A control voltage applied to the gate causes the material in the channel to act as
though it were P-type material, and electrons flow from the source to the drain
without having to cross a P-N junction. The source and drain of a MOSFET
serve the same functions as the emitter and collector of a bipolar transistor.
However, the source and drain can be interchanged, while the emitter and
collector of a bipolar transistor cannot.

mothball (equipment storage). A term used for the preservation of equipment or
machinery. When something is mothballed, it is sealed so moisture cannot get
into it. Desiccant materials (materials that absorb moisture) are packed inside the
equipment to absorb moisture from the air sealed in it, and the outside is covered
with whatever type of protection is appropriate. Airplanes and ships that have
been declared surplus by the military are often mothballed and stored in case
they are ever needed again.

downwind, side of a mountain barrier.
mouth, of a balloon envelope. The bottom, open end of a hot air balloon
envelope. Also called the “throat.”
movable slat. A movable auxiliary airfoil on the leading edge of a wing. It is
closed in normal flight but extends at high angles of attack. This allows air to

continue flowing over the top of the wing and delays airflow separation.

airport/heliport which are utilized for taxiing, hover taxiing, air taxiing, takeoff,
and landing of aircraft, exclusive of loading ramps and parking areas.

active devices (transistors or electron tubes) which alternate in conducting.
Multivibrators may be free running, bistable, or monostable. A free-running
multivibrator automatically switches back and forth between the devices and
continues to do this as long as power is supplied.

In a monostable multivibrator, one device is normally conducting, but a pulse
on its base or grid will switch it off and the other one on. As soon as the pulse is
removed, the conduction is switched back to the first.
In a bistable multivibrator, either device conducts equally well. A pulse on the
base or grid of the first device turns it off and causes the second one to conduct
until it receives a pulse on its base or grid. It then turns off, and conduction
reverts back to the first.

head must be ground off of a tool as soon as it forms.
mutual induction. The cause of a voltage being induced in one circuit by a
changing current in another circuit when there are no electrical connections
between the two. Changing current causes lines of magnetic flux to expand and
contract. When this changing flux cuts across the conductors in another circuit,
mutual induction causes a voltage to be induced in it.
MVA (minimum vectoring altitude) (air traffic control). The lowest MSL
altitude at which an IFR aircraft will be vectored by a radar controller, except as
otherwise authorized for radar approaches, departures, and missed approaches.
The altitude meets IFR obstacle clearance criteria, and it may be lower than the
published minimum en route altitude (MEA) along an airway or J-route segment.
It may be utilized for radar vectoring only upon the controller’s determination
that an adequate radar return is being received from the aircraft being controlled.
Charts depicting minimum vectoring altitudes are normally available only to the
controllers and not to pilots.

whose trailing edge fairs smoothly into the fuselage or engine nacelle. NACA
cowlings are used on the vast majority of modern radial engine installations.
The cooling air rams into the open front of the cowling and exits through an
annular slot at the rear. This slot is often covered with adjustable cowl flaps to
control the amount of cooling air allowed to flow through the engine. The airfoil
shape of the cowling produces a forward aerodynamic force that more than
compensates for the cooling drag of the engine.

nacelle. An enclosed compartment in an aircraft in which an engine is mounted.
Most multiengine propeller-driven airplanes have engine nacelles mounted on
the leading edge of the wings far enough out that the propellers clear the
fuselage. Multiengine jet-propelled airplanes often have their engines mounted
in nacelles on the sides of the fuselage between the wing and the tail, or in
nacelles hanging below the wings. Nacelles in which jet engines are mounted are
often called pods.

Needle bearings are effective for radial loads only.
needle valve. A fluid control valve that uses a long tapered needle to control the
amount of fluid that can flow through an orifice. The needle valve can be moved
into or out of the orifice. When the needle is completely in the orifice, the fluid
flow is minimum, and when it is completely out of the orifice, the flow is limited
by the size of the orifice. When the needle is neither fully in nor fully out, its
position controls the effective size of the orifice and thus the amount of fluid
allowed to flow.

“permission not granted,” or “that is not correct.”
negative (electrical condition). A condition in which there are more electrons
(negative charges) than there are protons (positive charges). A negative

acceleration is a decrease in speed with time and is expressed in such terms as

feet per second, per second or meters per second, per second.
negative angle of attack. The angle of attack that produces a downward
aerodynamic force. The horizontal stabilizer on an airplane is mounted in such a

causes a decrease in current through it. Under certain operating conditions, a
tunnel diode shows negative resistance (the more voltage across it, the less
current through it).
negative stagger (aircraft structure). The vertical alignment of the wings of a
biplane in which the lower wing is ahead of the upper wing. Most biplanes have
positive stagger, in which the upper wing is ahead of the lower wing. But the
distinctive appearance of the classic Beech Model 17, called the Staggerwing
Beechcraft, is due to its negative stagger.
negative static stability (aircraft stability). The type of static stability which
causes an aircraft, once disturbed from a condition of rest, to move further from
its condition of rest. Negative static stability is also called static instability.
negative temperature coefficient. A decrease in a value, such as resistance or
capacitance, with an increase in the temperature. A thermistor is a
semiconductor material with a large negative temperature coefficient of
resistance. Its resistance decreases greatly as its temperature increases. This
makes thermistors valuable in fire detection systems.
negative terminal (batteries). The terminal of a battery from which electrons
leave.
negative torque sensing system (propeller feathering system). The portion of a
propeller feathering system that senses the torque being produced by the engine.
If an engine fails in flight, its torque drops off drastically. The NTSS senses this
loss of torque and sends a signal to the propeller feathering system. The
propeller then automatically feathers. The blade pitch increases until the blades
are parallel with the air passing over them. Feathering the propeller stops the
engine rotation and reduces the drag.
negative vorticity (meteorology). Vorticity caused by anticyclonic turning.
Negative vorticity is associated with downward motion of the air.

neon bulb. A type of glow lamp made of two insulated electrodes inside a glass
envelope filled with neon gas. Neon gas does not conduct electricity until the
voltage across the electrodes rises to the ionization, or firing, voltage of the
neon. When this voltage is reached, the neon gas ionizes and conducts. Electrons
flowing through the ionized gas cause it to glow with a reddish-orange light. The
gas continues to glow until the voltage across the electrodes drops to a value
lower than its ionization voltage.
neon-bulb oscillator (electronic circuit). A relaxation oscillator using a neon bulb
to produce oscillation. The bulb is installed in parallel with a capacitor. When
DC voltage is applied to the circuit through a resistor, the voltage across the bulb
and capacitor rises until the ionization voltage of the bulb is reached. As soon as
the neon gas ionizes, it short-circuits the capacitor, and the voltage drops to the
deionization voltage, at which time conduction stops. The waveform of a neonbulb oscillator is a sawtooth.

voltage is the same between it and any of the other conductors. The neutral
conductor in a three-wire single-phase system is normally grounded with 110
volts between either line and the neutral conductor, and 220 volts between the
two lines. In a Y-connected, three-phase system, there is normally 120 volts
between any of lines and the neutral conductor and 208 volts between any two of
the lines.

neutral flame (oxygas welding). A flame that uses the chemically correct ratio of
fuel gas and oxygen. A neutral flame in an oxyacetylene torch has an almost
white, rounded inner cone and an envelope of light blue flame. Too much
oxygen changes a neutral flame into an oxidizing flame, and the inner cone
becomes pointed. Too much acetylene changes a neutral flame into a
carburizing, or reducing, flame, and a feather appears around the inner cone.

or neutralize, the effect of interelectrode capacitance in an electron tube.
neutral line. See neutral axis (structures).

an aircraft, if disturbed from its condition of rest, will neither attempt to deviate
farther from this condition nor to return to its original condition.
neutron. A particle in the nucleus of an atom which has mass, but no electrical
charge. A neutron has about the same mass as a proton, and it adds weight to the
atom, but does not affect its chemical behavior. Neutrons serve as a “cement” to
hold the protons in the nucleus of an atom.
newton. a unit of force in the metric system. One newton is the amount of force
needed to cause a mass of one kilogram (1,000 grams) to accelerate at a rate of
one meter per second each second the force acts on it. One newton is equal to
100,000 dynes, or 2.248 · 10–1 pound.

The amount of acceleration imparted to an object by a force is directly
proportional to the amount of force acting on it, and inversely proportional to the
mass of the object. The greater the force, the greater the acceleration, and the
greater the mass, the less the acceleration.

Newton’s third law of motion. The law of physics relating to action and reaction.
For every action, there is an equal and opposite (equal amount and opposite

object penetrations, except for frangible NAVAID locations that are fixed by
function. Additionally, vehicles, equipment, and personnel may be authorized by
air traffic control to enter the area using the provisions of FAA Order 7110.65,
Air Traffic Control, paragraph 3-1-5. The runway OFZ, and where applicable,
the inner-approach OFZ and the inner-transitional OFZ, comprise the OFZ.
obstacle identification slope (OIS). A departure procedure is structured to
provide at least 48 feet per NM of clearance above objects that do not penetrate
the obstacle slope, which is based on a 40 to 1 ratio, the equivalent of a 152-foot
per NM slope.
obstacle identification surface (OIS). The slope integrated into a departure
procedure that is designed to provide at least 48 feet per NM of clearance above
objects that do not penetrate the obstacle slope, using a 200 feet per NM climb.
The slope, known as the obstacle identification surface, is based on a 40 to 1
ratio, which is equivalent to a 152-foot per NM slope. The design of the
departure assumes an initial climb of 200 feet per NM after crossing the
departure end of the runway (DER) at a height of at least 35 feet above the
ground.

octane rating (reciprocating engine fuel rating). The system used to rate the
ability of a reciprocating-engine fuel to resist detonation. The higher the octane
number, the more resistant the fuel is to detonation. The fuel being rated is run in
a test engine whose compression ratio can be varied. This ratio is changed until
the fuel detonates, or explodes inside the cylinder, rather than burning as it
should. The engine is left with the compression ratio that caused the fuel to

detonate, and a fuel composed of a mixture of iso-octane, a fuel that resists
detonation, and heptane, a fuel prone to detonate, is fed to the engine.
The ratio of the two fuels is varied until the engine detonates as it did with the
fuel being rated. When the performance with the two fuels is matched, the ratio
of the octane to heptane is noted, and the fuel is rated with the percentage of
octane used. If a mixture of 80% octane and 20% heptane causes the engine to
perform as it did with the fuel being rated, the fuel is given an octane number of
80. At one time aviation gasoline was given a dual rating such as 80/87. The first
number represented its antidetonation rating with a lean, cruise fuel-air mixture,
and the higher number, its rating with a rich, takeoff mixture. Fuel with
antidetonation characteristics better than that of iso-octane is rated in
performance numbers. See performance numbers.
octave. An interval of audible vibrations spanning eight full tones above or
below another. A tone, in this regard, is a sound with a distinct pitch.
odd harmonics. The odd multiples of a fundamental frequency. For example,
frequencies that are three, five, seven, and nine times that of a fundamental, or
original, frequency are odd harmonics of the frequency.
odometer. The portion of an automobile speedometer that indicates the distance
traveled.
ODP. See obstacle departure procedure.
oersted. A unit of magnetic intensity in the centimeter-gram-second system of
measurement. One oersted is the amount of magnetic intensity equal to one
gilbert per square centimeter, and this is 79.577 ampere-turns per meter.
off-airport (in UA operations). Any location that is used to launch or recover an
unmanned aircraft (UA), but that is not considered an airport. An example of an
off-airport location is an open field.
off-airway routes. The FAA prescribes altitudes governing the operation of
aircraft under IFR for off-airway routes in a similar manner to those on federal
airways, jet routes, area navigation low or high altitude routes, and other direct
routes for which an MEA is designated.
off course (air traffic control). A term used to describe a situation where an
aircraft has reported a position fix or is observed on radar at a point not on the
ATC-approved route of flight.

off-idle mixture (aircraft fuel metering system adjustment). The fuel-air mixture
ratio produced by a fuel metering system during the time the engine is
transitioning from its idle RPM to a speed at which fuel is metered through the
main metering system.
off-route obstruction clearance altitude (OROCA) (air traffic control). An offroute altitude which provides obstruction clearance with a 1,000-foot buffer in
nonmountainous terrain areas and a 2,000-foot buffer in designated mountainous
areas within the United States. This altitude may not provide signal coverage
from ground-based navigational aids, air traffic control radar, or
communications coverage.
off-route vector (air traffic control). A vector by ATC which takes an aircraft off
a previously assigned route. Altitudes assigned by ATC during such vectors
provide required obstacle clearance.
offset parallel runways. Staggered runways having center lines which are
parallel.
offset rivet set (sheet-metalworking tool). A rivet set, used in a pneumatic rivet
gun, in which the cup that fits the manufactured head of the rivet is offset from
the center line of the rivet set shank. Offset rivet sets are used to drive rivets in a
location where a straight set cannot be used.
offset screwdriver. A screwdriver whose blade is perpendicular to the handle.
Offset screwdrivers are used to turn screws where there is not enough clearance
to allow the use of a regular screwdriver.
offset throw (crankshaft design). Crank arms on a reciprocating engine
crankshaft. The arms, or throws, to which the connecting rods and pistons are
attached are offset from the center of the crankshaft to move the pistons in and
out of the cylinder. The amount of the offset determines the stroke of the engine.
offshore/control airspace area. That portion of airspace between the U.S. 12 NM
limit and the oceanic CTA/FIR boundary within which air traffic control is
exercised. These areas are established to provide air traffic control services.
Offshore/Control Airspace Areas may be classified as either Class A airspace or
Class E airspace.

program, for example, is a standard program that can be bought and used, rather

than having a custom program written.
OFZ (obstacle free zone) (air traffic control). A three dimensional volume of
airspace which provides protection for the transition of aircraft to and from the
runway. The OFZ clearing standard precludes taxiing and parked airplanes and
object penetrations, except for frangible NAVAID locations that are fixed by
function. Additionally, vehicles, equipment, and personnel may be authorized by
air traffic control to enter the area using the provisions of FAA Order 7110.65,
Air Traffic Control, paragraph 3-1-5. The runway OFZ, and where applicable,
the inner-approach OFZ and the inner-transitional OFZ, comprise the OFZ.
ohm (Ω). The standard unit of electrical resistance. One ohm is the resistance of
a column of mercury weighing 14.4521 grams, formed into a column of uniform
cross section and a length of 1,006.3 centimeters. This standard resistance is
measured with the mercury having a temperature of 0°C. More practically, one
ohm is the amount of resistance that will cause a voltage drop of one volt when
one ampere of current flows through it.
Ohm’s law. The law that explains the relationship between the flow of electrons
(current), electrical pressure (voltage), and the opposition to flow (resistance).
According to Ohm’s law, the amount of current flowing in a circuit is directly
proportional to the circuit voltage and inversely proportional to the circuit
resistance.
ohmmeter. An electrical measuring instrument that measures the resistance in a
circuit or component and shows its value in ohms. An ohmmeter determines the
value of an unknown resistance by measuring the current flowing through it
when the voltage across it is known.
ohms-per-volt (voltmeter sensitivity). A measure of the sensitivity of a
voltmeter, found by dividing one by the amount of current (in amperes) needed
to deflect the pointer of the meter full scale.

For example, a meter that requires one milliamp (0.001 amp) of current for fullscale pointer deflection has a sensitivity of 1,000 ohms per volt.

The greater the ohms-per-volt, the more sensitive the meter.
oil analysis. A method of measuring the contents in parts per million of various
chemical elements in a sample of oil. A sample of the oil is burned in an electric
arc, and the resulting light is analyzed with a spectroscope which identifies the
chemical elements in the oil and gives an indication of the amount of each
element.
oil can (sheet metal problem). A condition in which a flat piece of sheet metal is
stretched so it snaps in and out between rows of rivets, in the same way the
bottom of an oil can snaps in and out.
oil circuit breaker. A protection device for electrical circuits that carry large
amounts of current. The housing containing the current-carrying contacts is
filled with oil which quenches the arc that forms as the contacts open.
Quenching the arc prevents damage to the contacts when they open a circuit
carrying a large amount of current.
oil control ring (reciprocating engine component). One of the cast-iron rings
installed in grooves around a piston. The oil control ring is installed in the
groove below the compression rings (top rings), and it is usually made in several
sections. The oil control ring controls the amount of oil allowed to flow between
the piston and the cylinder wall. Excess oil is drained back into the crankcase
through holes drilled through the piston in the ring groove.
oil-cooled transformer (electrical transformer). An electrical transformer whose
core and coils are immersed in oil. The oil circulates through the transformer and
carries heat from the core and windings to the housing. Air flowing around the
housing removes this heat. The housings for small oil-cooled transformers have
a smooth outer surface, but the housing of larger units is sometimes finned to
assist in carrying away heat.
oil cooler (reciprocating engine component). An air-oil heat exchanger, used to
remove excess heat from the lubricating oil. If the oil is too hot as it leaves the
engine, it flows through the oil cooler, where it gives up the excess heat to the air
flowing through or around the tubes in the cooler. The cooled oil then returns to
the engine oil sump or to the oil tank.
oil-damped bearing (gas turbine component). A type of roller bearing installation
in a gas turbine engine in which the outer race is installed in an oil damper
compartment whose inside diameter is a few thousandths of an inch larger than

the outside diameter of the outer race. Oil under pressure fills the oil damper
compartment and allows the bearing to compensate for sight misalignment and
to absorb vibrations of the shaft.
oil dilution (reciprocating engine operation). A method of treating the lubricating
oil to make it possible to start a reciprocating engine when the temperature is
very low. When the oil gets cold, it becomes thick and hard to move, making it
difficult for the starter to turn the engine over fast enough for it to start. Before
shutting the engine down, enough gasoline from the fuel system is mixed with
the lubricating oil to dilute it, so the starter can turn the engine over when the oil
is cold. When the engine starts and the oil warms up, the gasoline evaporates
from it. The oil is not damaged by diluting it. Oil dilution is no longer needed
because multiviscosity oil is thin enough at low temperature to allow the engine
to start.
oil filter (lubrication system component). A device in the lubrication system of
either a reciprocating engine or a gas turbine engine that removes contaminants
suspended in the oil.
oil hardening (metal heat treatment). A method of hardening steel by heating it
red-hot and then quenching it in a bath of oil. Oil cools the steel more slowly
than either water or brine and gives it a uniform hardness.
oilite bushing. A type of self-lubricating bushing. Oilite bushings are made of a
porous bronze material impregnated with oil. They can be pressed into holes to
decrease the resistance to shafts turning in the holes. When a shaft turns in an
oilite bushing, it produces heat that brings the oil to the surface and provides
lubrication between the bushing and the shaft.
Oilite bushings must never be washed, as washing removes the oil.
oil jet (lubricating system component). A small nozzle which directs a stream of
lubricating oil to a specific point to be lubricated. Oil jets are used to direct oil to
bearings and gears.
oil pan (reciprocating engine component). The removable lower part of the
crankcase of a reciprocating engine. Engine lubricating oil is collected and
stored in the pan and is taken from the pan by the pressure pump and forced
through passages in the engine. Gravity then drains the oil back into the pan. An
oil pan is commonly called an oil sump.
oil pressure indicator (aircraft engine instrument). An instrument used to show

the pilot or flight engineer the pressure of the lubricating oil being delivered to
the engine bearings.
oil scraper ring (reciprocating engine component). Another name for an oil wiper
ring. See oil wiper ring.
oil screen (lubricating system component). A fine-mesh wire screen used inside
an engine lubricating system to trap contaminants suspended in the lubricating
oil. A screen is not as effective as a filter, and many engines use both screens
and filters.
oil seal (engine component). A type of seal used in an engine to prevent oil
leaking from the engine around a rotating shaft.

oil separator. A device used to remove oil from the air discharged from an oillubricated air pump. A wet, vane-type air pump is lubricated and sealed by a
small amount of engine oil flowing through the pump. This oil must be removed
before the air can be used.
An oil separator contains a series of baffles over which the pump-discharge air
must pass. Any oil in the air sticks to the baffles and drains to the bottom of the
separator housing, and from here it is returned to the engine crankcase. Air from
which the oil has been removed leaves the separator from a connection above
and beyond the baffles.

oil slinger. A ridge around a rotating shaft on the engine side of an oil seal. The
slinger throws much of the oil away from the shaft, back into the engine
crankcase, before it reaches the oil seal.
oil sump (engine lubricating system component). An engine component designed
to hold the lubricating oil. In a wet-sump engine, the entire supply of oil is held
in the sump. In a dry-sump engine, the sump is small and holds the oil only until
the scavenger pump can move it into an external oil tank.
oil tank pressurizing valve (turbine lubricating system component). A check
valve in the oil tank vent system that maintains an air pressure of between 3 and
6 psi on the oil. This pressure assures a positive flow of oil to the engine-driven
oil pump at all altitudes.
oil temperature indicator (aircraft engine instrument). An engine instrument that
shows the pilot or flight engineer the temperature of the oil as it enters the
engine.
oil temperature regulator (reciprocating engine component). The device used to
keep the temperature of the oil entering the engine within allowable limits. This
type of regulator controls the temperature by directing hot oil through the core of
the oil cooler and cold oil around the cooler or between the core and the shell.
oil wiper ring (reciprocating engine component). One of the cast-iron rings
installed in the grooves around a piston. The oil wiper ring is the bottom ring on
a piston, and its purpose is to direct oil up between the piston and the cylinder
wall for lubrication and sealing. The amount of oil allowed to remain between
the piston and the cylinder wall is determined by the oil control ring. See oil
control ring.
OIS. See obstacle identification surface.
oleo strut (aircraft shock absorber). A type of hydropneumatic (oil-air) shock
absorber used on aircraft landing gear. The shock of the landing impact is
absorbed by oil flowing through a metering orifice (restricting hole). The smaller
shocks from taxiing are taken up by a cushion of compressed air.
OM. Outer marker of the ILS.
Omega navigation system. A worldwide, electronic, hyperbolic navigation
system. A master and one or more slave stations transmit a CW (continuous
wave) signal simultaneously on the same VLF (very-low-frequency) carrier. The

receiving aircraft measures the phase difference between these signals as they
are received, and plots, on a hyperbolic chart, the line of position on which this
phase difference can occur. The lines of position from two Omega stations cross
at the location of the aircraft.
omission error (flight training). In instrument training: failing to anticipate
significant instrument indications following attitude changes; for example,
concentrating on pitch control while forgetting about heading or roll
information, resulting in erratic control of heading and bank.
OMNI (electronic navigation system). A term used for the VOR, Very-highfrequency Omni-Range, navigation system. See VOR.
omni bearing selector (electronic navigation instrument). A component in the
VOR system on which the pilot selects the radial from the VOR station along
which he wishes to fly. The omni bearing selector (OBS) shifts the phase of the
reference signal inside the instrument, so the needle on the course deviation
indicator (CDI) will center when the aircraft is on the selected radial.
omnidirectional antenna (radio antenna). A type of radio antenna that has the
same field strength in all horizontal directions. An omnidirectional antenna is
also called a nondirectional antenna.
omnidirectional microphone. A microphone that picks up sounds equally well
from all directions around it. An omnidirectional microphone is also called a
nondirectional microphone.
onboard lightning detection systems. An onboard weather detection system that
senses electrical discharges suggestive of the presence of thunderstorm cells.
onboard weather radar. An onboard system capable of detecting significant
masses of precipitation. The primary use of weather radar is to aid the pilot in
avoiding thunderstorms and their associated hazards.
on-condition maintenance (aircraft maintenance). A type of aircraft maintenance
in which parts are replaced only when their condition is such that they appear to
be no longer airworthy. On-condition maintenance differs from life-limited
maintenance, in which a part is replaced at the end of a specified number of
operational hours or operational cycles, regardless of its apparent condition.
on course (air traffic control). Term used to indicate that an aircraft is established
on the route centerline, or used by ATC to advise a pilot making a radar

approach that his/her aircraft is lined up on the final approach course.
on-course indication (air traffic control). An indication on an instrument which
provides the pilot a visual means of determining that the aircraft is located on the
center line of a given navigational track, or an indication on a radarscope that an
aircraft is on a given track.
on-demand operation. Any operation for compensation or hire that is (1)
passenger-carrying conducted as a public charter (per 14 CFR Part 380) in which
departure time and location are negotiated with the customer and that is any of
the following types of operations: common carriage, noncommon carriage, or
rotorcraft; or (2) is scheduled passenger-carrying conducted with a frequency of
less than five round trips per week, on at least one route between two or more
points according to published flight schedules, in airplanes (other than turbojetpowered) with a maximum passenger-seat configuration of 9 seats or less and a
maximum payload capacity of 7,500 pounds or less, or in rotorcraft; or (3) allcargo operations conducted with airplanes having a payload capacity of 7,500
pounds or less, or with rotorcraft.
one-hundred-and-eighty-degree ambiguity (navigation system error). An error
inherent in some types of radio direction finding equipment in which the
equipment cannot distinguish whether the signal being received is ahead of the
aircraft or behind it. Automatic direction finding (ADF) equipment solves this
problem by using a sense antenna.
one-hundred-hour inspection (aircraft maintenance inspection). An inspection
required by 14 CFR §91.409 for FAA-certificated aircraft that are operated for
hire, or are used for flight instruction for hire. A 100-hour inspection is similar in
content to an annual inspection, but it can be conducted by an aircraft mechanic
who holds an Airframe and Powerplant rating, but does not have an Inspection
Authorization. A list of the items that must be included in an annual or 100-hour
inspection is included in 14 CFR Part 43, Appendix D.
one-minute weather. The most recent one-minute updated weather broadcast
received by a pilot from an uncontrolled airport ASOS/AWOS.
one-shot rivet gun (sheet-metal working tool). A hard-hitting air hammer, used
to drive large, solid aluminum alloy rivets. A one-shot rivet gun hits the rivet
with a single hard blow each time the trigger is pulled. This is different from the

action of an ordinary rivet gun, which delivers a continuous series of blows as
long as the trigger is held down.
Aluminum alloy rivets are strain hardened by repeated hammering, and they
can become so brittle they crack. To prevent this, they can be driven with a
single hard blow from a one-shot rivet gun.
one-to-one vibration (rotorcraft). A low frequency vibration having one beat per
revolution of the rotor. This vibration can be either lateral, or vertical.
on-speed condition (propeller governor condition). The condition of a propeller
governor when the engine is turning at the speed selected by the governor. The
centrifugal force acting on the flyweights in the governor is exactly balanced by
the compression of the speeder spring.
OODA loop. A model for aeronautical decision making based on the concept of
a recurring cycle (or loop) of “observe, orient, decide, act.” It is a standard
description of decision-making cycles that provides immediate feedback
throughout the process. Using the OODA loop, it is possible to have multiple
decision-making cycles in progress and in different stages of completion.
open angle (sheet metal forming). An angle in which sheet metal is bent less
than 90°.

open-assembly time (adhesive consideration). The amount of time allowed to
elapse between the spreading of an adhesive on the surfaces to be joined and the
time the surfaces are clamped together.
open-center hydraulic system. A fluid power system in which the selector valves
are arranged in series with each other. Fluid flows from the pump through the
center of all of the selector valves, back into the reservoir when no unit is being
actuated.
open-center selector valve (hydraulic system component). A type of selector
valve that functions as an unloading valve as well as a selector valve. All opencenter selector valves are installed in series, and when no unit is being actuated,

fluid from the pump flows through the centers of all of the valves and returns to
the reservoir.
When a unit is selected for actuation, the center of the selector valve is shut off
and the fluid from the pump goes through the selector valve into one side of the
actuator. Fluid from the other side of the actuator returns to the valve and goes
back to the reservoir through the other selector valves. When the actuation is
completed, the selector valve is placed in its neutral position. Its center opens,
and fluid from the pump flows straight through the valve, unloading the pump.
open circuit (electrical circuit condition). A condition in which there is no
complete path for electrons to flow from one terminal of the source of electrical
energy to the other terminal.
open-circuit voltage. The voltage of a battery measured when it is supplying no
current to the circuit. Open-circuit voltage is higher than closed-circuit voltage
because there is no voltage drop across internal resistance of the battery.
open-end wrench (mechanic’s hand tool). A hand tool used by mechanics to turn
nuts and bolts. The jaws of the wrench are in the form of a slot with parallel
sides that fit the nut or the bolt head. These jaws are usually offset from the axis
of the handle by about 15°.
open-hearth furnace. A furnace used for melting metals. Pig iron and scrap metal
are placed in a shallow hearth within the furnace and are melted by heat supplied
by a direct flame and from radiation from the walls and ceiling of the furnace.
open wiring (aircraft electrical system installation). Electrical wiring installation
in which the wires are tied together in bundles and clamped to the aircraft
structure rather than being enclosed in conduit.

purpose (except as provided in §91.13 of this chapter) of air navigation including
the piloting of aircraft, with or without the right of legal control (as owner,
lessee, or otherwise).”
operate time (electrical relay). The time measured from the instant a relay
control switch closes until the relay contacts are fully open or fully closed.

define limitations on maneuvers, flight load factors, speeds, and other limits.
They are presented in the aircraft in the form of placards and printed in the
limitations section of the aircraft flight manual.
operating pressures (fluid mechanics). The pressure range experienced in a
hydraulic or pneumatic system during normal operation.
operating weight (weight and balance). The empty weight of the aircraft plus the

is loaded for flight.
operational checks (aircraft operation). The inspection of a system to determine
if it is operating within normal limits specified by the manufacturer.
operational control. 14 CFR Part 1: “With respect to a flight, means the exercise
of authority over initiating, conducting or terminating a flight.”
operational pitfalls (psychology). Classic behavioral traps into which pilots have
been known to fall. Pilots, particularly those with considerable experience, as a
rule, always try to complete a flight as planned, please passengers, and meet
schedules. The basic drive to meet or exceed goals can have an adverse effect on
safety, and can impose an unrealistic assessment of piloting skills under stressful

conditions. These tendencies ultimately may bring about practices that are
dangerous and often illegal, and may lead to a mishap. A pilot will develop
awareness and learn to avoid many of these operational pitfalls through effective
ADM training.
operation rain check (air traffic control). A program designed and run by local
ATC facility management to familiarize pilots and aspiring pilots with the ATC
system, its functions, responsibilities, and benefits.
operations specifications (OpsSpecs). A published document providing the
conditions under which an air carrier and operator for compensation or hire must
operate in order to retain approval from the FAA.

operator (of an aircraft). Any person who causes or authorizes the operation of
an aircraft, such as the owner, lessee, or bailee of an aircraft.
opposed-type engine. A reciprocating engine with two banks of cylinders
directly opposite each other with a crankshaft in the center. The pistons of both

be either liquid-cooled or air-cooled, the air-cooled version is used
predominantly in aviation. It can be mounted with the cylinders in either a
vertical or horizontal position.
opposite direction aircraft (air traffic control). Aircraft are operating in opposite
directions when (1) they are following the same track in reciprocal directions; or
(2) their tracks are parallel and the aircraft are flying in reciprocal directions; or

referenced. In the illustrated triangle, the solid line shows the side opposite the
angle Ø.

optical coupler. An optoelectronic device used to couple electronic circuits by
using electromagnetic radiation, either visible or invisible. The input circuit
contains some form of light source, usually a light-emitting diode (LED). The
intensity of the light is determined by the amount of current flowing in the input
circuit.
The output circuit contains a photodiode, phototransistor, or light-dependent
resistor. The light source and light sensor are mounted in a light-tight housing,
so the light emitted by the source striking the sensor controls the output of the
coupled circuit.

ground associated with landing, which causes a pilot to misread the spatial
relationships between the aircraft and the runway.
optical micrometer (precision measuring instrument). A precision instrument,
used to measure the depth of scratches and other surface damage to a piece of
material. The lens of the instrument is focused on the undamaged surface which
is used as a reference, and then it is focused at the bottom of the damage. The
amount the lens must be moved to change the focus is converted into a measure
of the depth of the damage.
optical pyrometer (temperature measuring instrument). An instrument used to
measure the temperature of molten metal inside a furnace. A piece of resistance
wire extends across the optical path of the instrument, and current through the
wire is increased until its heat causes the wire to glow. The user of the
instrument looks at the molten metal in the furnace through the instrument, and
while watching it, increases the current through the resistance wire until it glows
with exactly the same color as the molten metal. The indicator on the instrument
converts the amount of current flowing through the resistance wire into terms of
the temperature of the molten metal.

between electrical current and light. Optoelectronics makes use of light-emitting
and light-sensitive devices.
orange peel (finishing system problem). Roughness caused by the surface of a
finishing material drying before the material below the surface. The rough
surface may be caused by using the wrong viscosity finishing material, the
wrong amount of air pressure on the spray gun, or incorrect setting of the spray
gun controls. It can also be caused by holding the spray gun an incorrect distance
from the surface being sprayed.

ring-shaped seal with a round cross section, made of a resilient material. An Oring fits into a groove to form a seal between two parts.

O-rings are two-way seals; they seal in either direction. They can be used as
either packings between moving parts or gaskets between parts having no
relative motion.
ornithopter. A type of flying machine that has been proposed since the days of

electrical signals that relate to the mechanical movement being measured. These

signals are recorded on a time base in such a way that they produce a graphic
record of the way the mechanical movement changes with reference to time.
oscilloscope. An electrical measuring instrument that displays, on the face of a
cathode-ray tube, the way an electrical value changes with time. A high-velocity
beam of electrons strikes a phosphorescent coating on the inside of the cathoderay tube face and produces a visible glow. The beam is swept from side to side
by a time-controlled oscillator and deflected up and down by the electrical value
being measured.
osmium. A bluish-white, hard, metallic chemical element. Osmium’s symbol is
Os, its atomic number is 76, and its atomic weight is 190.2. Osmium is used as a
hardener for platinum to increase its wearing ability.
otolith organ. An inner ear organ that detects linear acceleration and gravity
orientation.
Otto thermodynamic cycle. The constant-volume cycle of energy transformation
used in a reciprocating engine. Fuel and air are drawn into the cylinder as the
piston moves to the bottom of its stroke. The fuel-air mixture is then compressed
as the piston moves upward in the cylinder, and when the piston is near the top
of its stroke, the mixture is ignited and burns. The burning mixture heats and
expands the air inside the cylinder and forces the piston down, performing useful
work. The piston then moves back up, forcing the burned gases out of the
cylinder. The pressure inside the cylinder varies throughout the cycle, but all
events take place in the same location.

conversation is ended and no response is expected.
outer area (air traffic control). Nonregulatory airspace surrounding designated
Class C airspace airports in which ATC provides radar vectoring and sequencing
on a full-time basis for all IFR and participating VFR aircraft. The normal radius
is 20 nautical miles, with some variations based on site-specific requirements.

extends from the lower limits of radar/radio coverage up to the ceiling of the
approach control’s delegated airspace, excluding the Class C charted area and
other airspace as appropriate.
outer compass locator (LOM). A compass locator installed at the site of the outer
marker of an instrument landing system. See outer marker.

outer fix (air traffic control). A general term used within ATC to describe fixes

normally cleared from these fixes to the final approach fix or final approach
course.
outer fix arc (air traffic control). A semicircle area, usually about a 50−70 mile

order to cross the vertex at the actual calculated landing time (ACLT). The time
reflects descent speed adjustments and any applicable delay time that must be
absorbed prior to crossing the meter fix.

the extended centerline of the runway.
outflow boundary (meteorology). A mesoscale cold front. Outflow boundaries
primarily originate from thunderstorms. See mesoscale.
outflow valve (aircraft pressurization system component). The valve in an
aircraft pressurization system that controls the pressure inside the aircraft cabin.
More air than needed is pumped into the cabin, and the outflow valve controls
the air allowed to escape to maintain the pressure in the cabin at the correct
level. Operation of the outflow valve is controlled by the cabin pressure
regulator.
outlook briefing (flight planning). This type of briefing is provided for planning
purposes only for a flight with a departure time of 6 or more hours away. It
provides initial forecast information that is limited in scope due to the timeframe
of the planned flight.
out-of-ground-effect (OGE) hover (rotorcraft). Hovering at a height greater than
one rotor diameter above the surface. Because induced drag is greater while
hovering out of ground effect, it takes more power to hover OGE.

out-of-phase. A condition of cyclic values in which two waves do not pass
through zero at the same time.
out-of-rig (aircraft flight condition). A condition of aircraft rigging that prevents
hands-off flight. When an aircraft is properly rigged and flown in still air at the
correct power setting, it will maintain its altitude and heading without the pilot
touching the controls. But, if it is out-of-rig, it will not hold its altitude nor its
heading.
out-of-round (condition of physical wear). The condition of a circular object
when its wear is not uniform around its circumference. Wear changes its shape
from circular to oblong.
out of service. The condition when a piece of equipment, or a system, facility, or
service is not operational, certified (if required), or immediately available for
ATC or public use.
out-of-track (helicopter rotor condition). A condition of a helicopter rotor in
which the blade tips do not follow the same path in their rotation.

load.
output transformer (electronic component). An audio-frequency transformer,
used between the last stage of an audio-frequency amplifier and a speaker. The
impedance of the amplifier’s output stage is usually quite high, and the
impedance of a speaker is low. For the maximum amount of power to be
transferred from the amplifier to the speaker, the impedance of the amplifier
must match that of the speaker, and this matching is done with an output
transformer.
outside air temperature (OAT). The temperature of the ambient air through
which an aircraft is flying.
outside calipers. A measuring device having two inwardly curved, hinged legs.
The calipers are closed until the points of the legs just touch the outside of the

a control surface in which the area behind the fulcrum is lighter than the area
ahead of the fulcrum. The trailing edge rises above the fulcrum.
overboost (reciprocating engine operation). A condition of excessive manifold
pressure in a reciprocating engine. Overboosting occurs when the supercharger
is operated at too high a speed.
overcompounded generator (electrical generator). An electrical generator which
has both a series and a shunt field with the effect of the series field being greater
than that of the shunt field. The output voltage tends to increase as the electrical
load increases.
overcompounded motor (electric motor). A compound-wound motor (a motor
having both a series and a shunt field) in which the series field has the greater
effect on the motor characteristics. The shunt, or parallel, field attempts to hold
the speed of the motor constant as the load changes, but the series field causes
the motor to speed up as the load increases.

In a flat compounded motor, the effects of the two fields cancel, and the motor
speed remains relatively constant as the load changes. In an overcompounded
motor, the series winding has the greater effect, and the motor tries to speed up
as the load increases.
overcontrol (flight condition). The application of a greater amount of control
movement than is needed for the desired result.
overcurrent protection device. A device in an alternator or generator control
system that reduces the output voltage when excessive current flows.

southeast side).
overhaul (maintenance procedure). The maintenance procedure in which a
device is disassembled to the extent needed to determine the condition of all its
parts. Each part is inspected, and, if damaged or excessively worn, it is repaired
or replaced. The device is then reassembled and tested, and if it functions as it
should, is returned to service.
overhead-cam engine (type of reciprocating engine). A reciprocating engine in
which the camshaft is located in the cylinder head. The valves are opened by
rocker arms that are actuated by the cam lobes. The valves of engines that have
the camshaft in the crankcase are actuated by pushrods and rocker arms.
overhead maneuver (traffic entry maneuver). A series of predetermined
maneuvers prescribed for aircraft, often in formation for entry into the VFR
traffic pattern and to proceed to a landing. An overhead maneuver is not an IFR
approach procedure. An aircraft executing an overhead maneuver is considered
VFR and the IFR flight plan is cancelled when the aircraft reaches the initial
point approach portion of the maneuver.
overhead question. In the guided discussion method, a question directed to the
entire group in order to stimulate thought and discussion from the entire group.
An overhead question may be used by an instructor as the lead-off question.

which the intake and exhaust valves are located in the cylinder head. This type
of engine is also called a valve-in-head engine.

overheat warning system (fire warning system). A type of warning system that
warns the flight crew that an engine nacelle or wheel well is too hot for normal
operation, but there is no localized high temperature that indicates the presence
of a fire.
overinflation valve (aircraft wheel component). A valve used in some large
aircraft wheels that mount tubeless tires. The valve opens and relieves the excess
pressure if the tire is accidentally overinflated.
overload. A load in excess of that designed for a system or structure.
overlying center (air traffic control). The ARTCC facility that is responsible for
arrival/departure operations at a specific terminal.
overpower. To use more power than required for the purpose of achieving a
faster rate of airspeed change.
overrunning clutch. A type of clutch that couples a drive element with a driven
element. When the drive element is being rotated, the driven element rotates
with it. But when the driven element is being rotated by an outside force, the
drive element does not turn. Overrunning clutches are used in some types of
aircraft engine starters. The starter rotates the engine through the clutch, but
when the engine starts and turns faster than the starter motor, the clutch prevents
the engine driving the starter.
overrunning, weather pattern. A relatively warm air mass is in motion above
another air mass of greater density at the surface. Embedded thunderstorms
sometimes develop in such a pattern.
overseas air commerce. 14 CFR Part 1: “The carriage by aircraft of persons or
property for compensation or hire, or the carriage of mail by aircraft, or the
operation or navigation of aircraft in the conduct or furtherance of a business or
vocation, in commerce between a place in any State of the United States, or the
District of Columbia, and any place in a territory or possession of the United
states; or between a place in a territory or possession of the United States, and a
place in any other territory or possession of the United States.”

or property as a common carrier for compensation or hire, or the carriage of mail
by aircraft, in commerce:

(1) Between a place in a State or the District of Columbia and a place in a
possession of the United States; or
(2) Between a place in a possession of the United States and a place in another
possession of the United States; whether that commerce moves wholly by
aircraft or partly by aircraft and partly by other forms of transportation.”
overshoot (flight operation). A landing approach in which an aircraft is still
airborne as it passes the touchdown point chosen by the pilot.
overshooting tops (meteorology). A dome-like protrusion above the anvil of a
thunderstorm, representing a very strong updraft; hence a higher potential for
severe weather exists with that storm. A persistent, large overshooting top (or
anvil dome) often is present with a supercell.
oversize stud (aircraft hardware). A special stud used to replace a standard stud
that has worn its hole oversize. The thread pitch and type are the same as those
of the standard stud, but the diameter of the oversize stud is greater.
overspeed condition (propeller governor condition). The condition in which an
engine is turning at a speed greater than that selected by the governor. The
upward force produced by the governor flyweights is greater than the downward
force of the speeder spring, and the governor causes the pitch of the propeller to
increase to reduce the engine speed.
overtemperature (engine operation). A condition in which an engine has reached
a temperature above that approved by the manufacturer, or any exhaust
temperature that exceeds the maximum allowable for a given operating condition
or time limit. Overtemperature can cause internal damage to an engine.
overtemperature warning system. A warning system similar in many ways to a
fire warning system, but differing in that it initiates the warning signal at a lower
temperature than needed for a fire warning. A high temperature in a small area
initiates a fire warning, but a lower temperature over a larger area indicates an
overtemperature condition.
over-the-top. 14 CFR Part 1: “Above the layer of clouds or other obscuring
phenomena forming the ceiling.”
overtone. A whole-number multiple of the frequency of a vibration. An overtone
is the same as a harmonic. See harmonic.
overtorque (engine operation). A condition in which a turboprop or turboshaft

engine has produced more torque than the manufacturer recommends, or where
the engine torque has exceeded the maximum allowable for a given operating
condition or time limit. Overtorque can cause internal damage to an engine.
overvoltage protector (electrical circuit component). A component used to
protect electrical circuits from surges of high voltage that could cause damage. A
sensor monitors the voltage and, if it becomes excessive, the overvoltage
protector opens the circuit to protect the components.

produces a flame temperature in the range of 5,700°F to 6,300°F. Oxyacetylene
gas is used for welding and cutting metal, principally steel.
oxygas welding. A form of welding in which a fuel gas, such as acetylene or
hydrogen, is mixed with oxygen in the mixing chamber of a torch. When these
gases are burned, they produce the large amount of heat needed to melt the metal
so it can be welded.
oxygen. A colorless, odorless, tasteless, gaseous chemical element that makes up
about 21% of the earth’s atmosphere. Oxygen’s symbol is O, its atomic number
is 8, and its atomic weight is 15.9994. Oxygen will not burn, but it supports
combustion and combines chemically with all other elements except the inert
gases. Oxygen is absolutely necessary to support human and animal life.
oxygen concentration cell corrosion. Corrosion that occurs when some of the
electrolyte on a metal surface is partially confined (such as between faying
surfaces or in a deep crevice). Metal in this confined area corrodes more rapidly
than other metal surfaces of the same part outside this area. See concentration
cell corrosion.

oxygen starvation (hot air ballooning). The condition inside a balloon envelope
where all available oxygen has been consumed by the heater flame and
additional burning is impossible since propane must have oxygen to burn. In
extreme cases, the blast flame and pilot light flame will extinguish after a long
burn or series of burns and may not relight until the envelope has “breathed”
additional air.
ozone. An unstable form of oxygen. A molecule of ozone contains three atoms
of oxygen (O3), rather than two, as in a molecule of oxygen gas (O2). Ozone is
blue in color, and it smells much like chlorine. Ozone, which is produced by
passing an electric spark through oxygen, is a powerful oxidizing agent and is
used as a bleach and in the treatment of industrial wastes. Ozone is harmful to
rubber products.
ozone layer (atmospheric science). An atmospheric layer that contains a high
proportion of oxygen that exists as ozone (O3). It acts as a filtering mechanism
against incoming ultraviolet radiation. It is located between the troposphere and
the stratosphere, around 9.5 to 12.5 miles (15 to 20 kilometers) above the earth’s
surface.
ozonosphere. The layer of the earth’s atmosphere that extends from about 20 to
30 miles above the earth. The ozonosphere has a high concentration of ozone
that absorbs ultraviolet radiation from the sun.

pack carburizing (metal heat treatment). A method of case hardening the surface
of a steel part without hardening the inside and making it brittle. The part to be
case hardened is packed in a fire-clay container and entirely surrounded with a
special ground-up charcoal. The container is sealed and put into a furnace and
heated to a temperature greater than 910°C. At this temperature, the iron takes
on a crystalline form called gamma iron. The heated charcoal releases carbon
monoxide, and since it cannot escape, it combines with the gamma iron and
forms an extremely hard surface. The depth to which the carbon penetrates the
steel is determined by the length of time it is held at this high temperature.
packing. A seal used between surfaces in which there is relative movement.
When there is no movement between the surfaces, a gasket is used to provide the
seal.
page. Any one of a collection of information displays that appear on the
FMS/RNAV unit. Every page has a title and presents information related to a
particular navigation topic (e.g., airport elevation, runways, communication
frequencies). Pages are usually arranged in divisions called “chapters,” which
group pages of similar information by topic (e.g., airports, approaches, VORs).
paint. A covering applied to an object or structure to protect it and improve its
appearance. Paint consists of a pigment suspended in a vehicle such as oil or
water. When the vehicle, which can be thinned for best application, dries by
evaporation or curing, the pigment is left as a film on the surface.
paint dryer. A component, usually an oil, added to a paint to improve its drying
characteristics.

paint stripper. A material used to remove paint from a surface. Paint stripper
contains very strong solvents in a wax-like vehicle which prevents the solvents
from evaporating before they can soak into the paint film.
Most paint strippers soften a lacquer film, so it can be wiped off. But rather
than softening a film of enamel, the stripper penetrates it and causes it to swell.
When the film swells, it wrinkles and breaks away from the surface on which it
is applied. The wrinkled enamel is then scrubbed from the surface or washed off
with steam or hot water.
palladium. A soft, ductile, steel-white, tarnish-resistant metallic chemical
element. Palladium’s symbol is Pd, its atomic number is 46, and its atomic
weight is 106.4. Palladium is used in the manufacture of electrical contacts,
jewelry, and surgical instruments.
Pal nut. The registered trade name for a thin, pressed-steel nut which has a
shallow cup-shaped bottom surface. A Pal nut is screwed down over the top of a
plain nut to lock the nut onto a stud. When the Pal nut is tightened, the bent-up
threads are forced down, so they hold pressure on the plain nut and prevent its
vibrating loose.
pan-pan (urgency signal). The international radio-telephony urgency signal.
When repeated three times, pan-pan indicates uncertainty or alert, followed by
the nature of the urgency.
pancake landing (aircraft operation). A landing in which the aircraft is flared out

has a large-diameter head that is slightly crowned, or rounded, on top.

pants (airplane wheel covers). A commonly used name for the streamlined wheel
covers installed on some fixed landing gear airplanes.
paper capacitor (electrical component). A type of capacitor made of two strips of
metal foil for its plates and strips of waxed paper for its dielectric. Leads are
attached to the metal foil, and the foil and waxed paper are formed into a tight,
compact roll. The entire roll is then encapsulated in a plastic resin. A mark or
line around one end of a paper capacitor identifies the lead attached to the
outside layer of foil.
PAPI. See precision approach path indicator.
PAR (precision approach radar). A type of radar used at an airport to guide an
aircraft through the final stages of landing. The radarscope has two plots: one
showing the position of the aircraft along an extended center line of the runway,
and the other showing the position of the aircraft as it descends along the glide
slope to the runway. The radar operator directs the pilot to change heading or
adjust the descent rate to keep the aircraft on a path that allows it to touch down
at the correct spot on the runway.
parabola. A curve formed by points that are an equal distance from a straight line
and from a fixed point.
parabolic microphone. An extremely sensitive microphone mounted at the focus
of a parabolic sound reflector. The reflector is aimed at the source of sound to be
picked up, and the parabolic surface reflects the sound waves, concentrating
them at the microphone.
parabolic reflector (light reflector). A light reflector whose surface is made in the
form of a parabola. The filament producing the light is located at the focus of the
parabola, and the light is reflected from the parabolic surface as a beam of
parallel rays.
parachute. A large umbrella-shaped device, made of lightweight cloth, used to
slow an object falling through the air. Parachutes are folded into a pack and
worn by a person who jumps from an aircraft. When the pack is opened, the
parachute canopy is pulled out by the air and opens. The parachute creates so
much drag that the wearer descends at a rate slow enough to prevent injury when
contact is made with the ground. Cargo parachutes are used to lower equipment
at locations where it is impractical for airplanes or helicopters to land.
14 CFR Part 1: “A device used or intended to be used to retard the fall of a

body or object through the air.”
parachute top (hot air balloon). A deflation system wherein the deflation port is
sealed with a disc of balloon fabric shaped like a parachute. Lines attached to the
edge of the parachute disc gather into a single line that may be pulled down by
the pilot in the basket.
parafoil. See ram-air wing.
par-al-ketone. A heavy waxlike grease, used to protect cables, bolts, and other
types of fittings from rust and corrosion when they are exposed to water. Par-alketone is also used to protect metal objects that are to be stored for long periods
of time.
parallax. An optical (viewing) error caused by an object appearing to be in
different locations when it is viewed from different angles. Parallax causes a
pointer-type instrument to give an inaccurate indication unless it is viewed from
directly above the pointer. Moving your head as you read the dial can give
different indications. Precision instruments have a mirror built into the dial to
prevent parallax error. When reading such an instrument, move your eye until
the pointer is directly over its reflection. When viewed from this position there is
no parallax.
parallax error (optical phenomenon). A characteristic of airplanes that have sideby-side seats, where the pilot is seated to one side of the longitudinal axis about
which the airplane rolls. This makes the nose appear to rise when making a left
turn and to descend when making right turns, a common error among students
and experienced pilots.
parallel access (digital computers). A method of accessing data from a computer
in which all bits of the data are transferred at the same time. Parallel access is
different from serial access, in which the data is transferred one bit at a time.
parallel bus system (electrical power system). An electrical power system in
which all of the operating generators are connected to a single power bus.
parallel electrical circuit. A circuit in which the components are connected in
such a way that there is more than one complete path for electrons to pass from
the negative terminal of the power source back to its positive terminal.

parallel ILS approaches (air traffic control). Approaches to parallel runways by
IFR aircraft which, when established inbound toward the airport on the adjacent
final approach courses, are radar-separated by at least two miles.
paralleling circuit. A circuit in a multiengine aircraft electrical system that
causes the generators or alternators to share the electrical load equally.
paralleling generators (aircraft electrical system operation). The procedure in
which the output voltages of the generators in a multiengine aircraft electrical
system are adjusted so that they share the electrical load equally. If one generator
carries more than its share of the load, its output voltage is decreased and the
output of the other generators is increased until all share the load equally.
paralleling relay. A relay in a multiengine aircraft electrical system that controls
a flow of control current which is used to keep the generators or alternators
sharing the electrical load equally. The relay opens automatically to shut off the
flow of paralleling current any time the output of either alternator or generator
drops to zero.
parallel lines. Lines that run in the same direction and are at all points separated
by the same distance. Parallel lines never cross.
parallel offset route (air traffic control). A parallel track to the left or right of the
designated or established airway/route. Normally associated with area navigation
(RNAV) operations.
parallel operation (computer operation). Data transfer by moving digital words
(groups of bits) all at one time. Parallel operation is much faster than serial
operation, in which the bits are moved one at a time, but it requires much more
complex circuitry.

This is true until the elastic limit of the material is reached. If the elastic limit of
the material is exceeded, the material will not return to its original condition;
rather it will take a permanent set.
permeability (μ). A measure of the ease with which lines of magnetic flux can
pass through a material. The permeability of a material is found by dividing the
flux density (B), in lines per square inch, by the magnetizing force (H), in

mounted on a carrier, or spider, that is part of the propeller shaft. The planetary
gears also mesh with and rotate inside the fixed ring gear. When the sun gear
turns, the planetary gear spider rotates inside the ring gear and turns the propeller
shaft at a speed slower than that of the crankshaft.
The ratio between the speeds of the crankshaft and the propeller shaft is found
by dividing the sum of the teeth on the ring gear and the sun gear by the number

Platinum’s appearance is pleasing, and it is so durable it is used for jewelry.
platinum fine-wire spark plug (reciprocating engine component). An aircraft
spark plug whose electrodes are made of small-diameter platinum wire. Platinum
spark plugs are especially suited for use in reciprocating engines whose fuel
contains a large amount of tetraethyl lead. Tetraethyl lead produces lead oxides
inside the firing-end cavity of a spark plug, and enough of this oxide can build
up to foul the spark plug, preventing its firing.
Fine-wire platinum electrodes allow the firing-end cavity to be open enough
that the gases containing the lead are blown out, preventing the formation of the
lead buildup. Platinum can operate at such high temperatures that any lead
deposits which form on the electrodes will immediately burn off.

When the local altimeter setting is set on the barometric scale, the altimeter
shows indicated altitude. When standard sea level pressure of 29.92 inches of
mercury or 1013.2 millibars is set on the barometric scale, the altimeter shows
pressure altitude.
Another type of altimeter is an absolute (radar or radio) altimeter. It measures

density of the flux across the air gap between the pole shoe and the armature is
uniform.

poles of a magnet. The locations on a magnet where the lines of magnetic flux
leave and where they enter. In a ferromagnetic metal, groups of atoms whose
electrons have their spin axes in alignment are called magnetic domains. When
all of the domains are aligned in the same direction, the material is magnetized.
All magnets, regardless of their size, have two poles, a north pole and a south
pole. Lines of magnetic flux leave the magnet at its north pole and return
through its south pole. All the lines of flux leave and enter the poles at right
angles to the surface.

transparent tubing for insulating electrical wires. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
tubing is used for carrying low-pressure air to aircraft instruments.

land plane to convert it into a float plane.
poor judgment chain (psychology). A term used in aeronautical decision making
referring to a series of mistakes that may lead to an accident or incident. Two
basic principles generally associated with the creation of a poor judgment chain
are: (1) One bad decision often leads to another; and (2) as a string of bad
decisions grows, it reduces the number of subsequent alternatives for continued
safe flight. ADM is intended to break the poor judgment chain before it can
cause an accident or incident.
pop-out floats (helicopter component). Helicopter floats that are stored deflated
on the skids or in compartments along the lower portion of the helicopter, and

porous chrome plating. A method of treating the walls of aircraft reciprocating
engine cylinders that hardens them and increases their ability to hold lubricants.
Worn cylinder barrels may be ground so their bore is straight and round. Then
hard chromium is electroplated on the walls to a depth that brings the diameter
of the cylinder bore back to its original dimension.
The surface of the hard chrome plating resembles a maze of spiderwebs, with
thousands of tiny, interconnected cracks. After the correct depth of chromium
has been deposited, the electroplating current is reversed, and the tiny cracks
enlarge enough to hold oil.
Porous chrome plating provides a hard, wear-resistant surface over which the
piston rings ride. The oil trapped in the tiny grooves furnishes lubrication to
minimize piston ring and cylinder wall wear and helps the rings seal.

potential barrier (semiconductor characteristic). The voltage in a semiconductor
device on either side of a PN junction. Free electrons from the N-material
migrate across the junction to fill some of the holes in the P-material. This
migration causes a positive potential at the edge of the N-material, and a
negative potential at the edge of the P-material.
The potential barrier, sometimes called the potential hill, blocks any forward
current flow across the junction until the forward voltage is higher than that of
the potential barrier. The potential barrier in a silicon device is approximately
0.7 volt and approximately 0.3 volt in a germanium device.

potential difference. A difference in electrical pressure. A potential difference
exists when one component, or point, has an excess of electrons (a negative
charge) and another has a deficiency of electrons (a positive charge). Potential
difference is measured in volts.

forced through an electrical load under a pressure of one volt. One mechanical
horsepower is equal to 746 watts of electrical power.
power (exponent). A shorthand method of indicating how many times a number,
called the base, is multiplied by itself. For example, in the number 43, 3 is the
power, or exponent, and 4 is the base. That is, 43 is equal to 4 × 4 × 4 = 64.
power (mechanical). The time rate of doing work. Power is found by dividing
the amount of work done, measured in foot-pounds, by the time in seconds or
minutes used to do the work.

for the brake actuation. Aircraft that require a large amount of fluid for their
brake actuation normally use power brakes, and the volume of fluid sent to the
brakes is increased by the use of deboosters. See debooster.
power control system (aircraft flight control system). A type of control system in
which normal operation of the flight controls causes hydraulic or pneumatic

by the pilot. An irreversible power control system is a type of system that does
not allow forces on the flight control surfaces to be fed back to the cockpit
control.
power control valve (hydraulic system component). A hand-operated hydraulic
pump unloading valve. When the valve is open, fluid flows from the pump to the

The power enrichment system meters additional fuel when the throttle is wide
open. This fuel absorbs the excess heat. A power-enrichment system is also
called an economizer system.
power factor (electrical value). The ratio of the actual power to the apparent
power in an alternating current circuit. Actual power, measured by a wattmeter,
is the product of the circuit voltage and only that portion of the current in phase
with the voltage. Apparent power is the product of the circuit voltage and the
total circuit current. Power factor is also the ratio of the circuit resistance to the
circuit impedance, and is the cosine of the phase angle.
power frequencies (electrical power). The frequency of alternating current used
to provide electrical power. In the United States, 60 hertz is the most commonly
used power frequency. In other parts of the world, 50-hertz AC is used. Aircraft

that describes the process by which one controller allows an aircraft to penetrate
or transit another controller’s airspace in a manner that ensures standard
separation without individual coordination for each aircraft.

air below the cloud and the liquid droplets evaporate into water vapor. The water
vapor cools and at dew point, it condenses and fog forms.
precipitation heat treatment. A method of increasing the strength of heat-treated
aluminum alloy. After the aluminum alloy has been solution-heat-treated by
heating and quenching, it is returned to the oven and heated to a temperature
lower than that used for the initial heat treatment. It is held at this temperature
for a specified period of time and then removed from the oven and allowed to
cool slowly. Precipitation heat treatment is also known as artificial aging.
precipitation-induced downdraft (meteorology). Downdrafts that are the result of
precipitation beginning which drags the air downward, causing a downdraft.
precipitation intensity. See precipitation radar weather descriptions.

precipitation radar weather descriptions (air traffic control). The precipitation
intensity descriptors a controller provides to pilots when interpreting radar
weather returns. When the intensity levels can be determined, they are described
as: LIGHT (< 30 dBZ), MODERATE (30 to 40 dBZ), HEAVY (> 40 to 50
dBZ), or EXTREME (> 50 dBZ). Controllers issue (where the capability exists)
radar-observed precipitation intensity when using a weather and radar processor
(WARP), or ground-based digital radars with weather capabilities. When
precipitation intensity information is not available, the intensity will be
described as UNKNOWN.
All weather areas displayed on ATC radar are referred to as “precipitation”
because even though some systems can estimate levels of intensity, the type of
precipitation (whether rain, hail, or snow) cannot be detected by radar.
Furthermore, existing radar systems cannot detect turbulence, but there is a
direct correlation between the degree of turbulence as well as other weather
features associated with thunderstorms and the displayed weather radar
precipitation intensity.

runway visual range is below 4,000 feet).
precision runway monitor (PRM). Provides air traffic controllers with high
precision secondary surveillance data for aircraft on final approach to parallel

resolution color monitoring displays are required to present surveillance track
data to controllers along with detailed maps depicting approaches and no
transgression zone.
precision switch (electrical component). A snap-action switch that requires a
very small amount of movement for its actuation. The amount of movement
needed is the same each time the switch is actuated. Precision switches are used
in position-indicating circuits and as limit switches to start or stop an action any
time a mechanical device reaches a specific position.
pre-departure clearance (PDC). An application with the Terminal Data Link
System that provides clearance information to subscribers, through a service
provider, in text to the cockpit or gate printer.
predictive wind shear (PWS) alert system. A self-contained system used onboard
some aircraft to alert the flight crew to the presence of potential wind shear.
PWS systems typically monitor 3 miles ahead and 25 degrees left and right of
the aircraft’s heading at or below 1,200 feet AGL. Departing flights may receive
a wind shear alert after they start the takeoff roll and may elect to abort the
takeoff. Aircraft on approach receiving an alert may elect to go around or
perform a wind shear escape maneuver.
predrilling (sheet metal fabrication). The use of small holes drilled in sheet metal
parts to locate rivet holes. Replacement skin panels purchased from an aircraft
manufacturer have all the rivet holes predrilled in all of the proper locations with
holes smaller than that needed for the rivet. The replacement panel is put place
and a drill of the correct size for the rivet is passed through the hole in the
original skin and through the predrilled hole in the new skin.
preferential departure route (PDR). A specific departure route from an airport or
terminal area to an en route point where there is no further need for flow control.
It may be included in an instrument departure procedure or a preferred IFR
route.

preferential routes (air traffic control). Preferential routes are adapted in ARTCC
computers to accomplish inter/intrafacility controller coordination and to ensure
that flight data is posted at the proper control positions.
Locations having a need for these specific inbound and outbound routes
normally publish such routes in local facility bulletins, and their use by pilots
minimizes flight plan route amendments. When the workload or traffic situation
permits, controllers normally provide radar vectors or assign requested routes to
minimize circuitous routing. Preferential routes are usually confined to one
ARTCCs area and are referred to by the following names or acronyms:
• Preferential departure route (PDR).
• Preferential arrival route (PAR).
• Preferential departure and arrival route (PDAR).
preferred IFR routes (air traffic control). Routes established between busier
airports to increase system efficiency and capacity. Preferred IFR routes
normally extend through one or more ARTCC areas and are designed to achieve
balanced traffic flows among high density terminals. IFR clearances are issued
on the basis of these routes except when severe weather avoidance procedures or
other factors dictate otherwise.
Preferred IFR routes are listed in the Chart Supplement U.S., but if a flight is
planned to or from an area having such routes yet the departure or arrival point is
not listed in the Supplement, pilots may use that part of the preferred IFR route
which is appropriate for the departure or arrival point that is listed. Preferred IFR
routes are correlated with SIDs and STARs and may be defined by airways, jet
routes, direct routes between NAVAIDs, waypoints, NAVAID radials/DME, or
any combination of these items. See SID, STAR.
preferred runway. When there is no active runway, the preferred runway is
considered to be the most suitable operational runway taking into account such
factors as: the runway most nearly aligned with the wind; noise abatement or
other restrictions which prohibit the use of certain runways; ground traffic and
runway conditions.
preferred values (electrical components). A series of values for resistors and
capacitors, selected by the Electronic Industries Association (EIA) and the
military services. The steps between the values are chosen, so the difference
between any two steps is essentially the same percentage as the difference
between any other two steps. The use of preferred values allows the most

complete coverage of the needed values, with a minimum number of
components.
preflight inspection (aircraft inspection). An inspection of an aircraft performed
by the pilot or flight engineer before the aircraft is approved for flight. The
purpose of a preflight inspection is to assure that the aircraft is in a safe
condition for the flight being proposed.
preformed cable (aircraft control cable). A type of steel cable used in aircraft
control systems. Preformed cable is made up of seven bundles (strands) of wires
wound together to form the complete cable. Each strand is formed into a spiral
(preformed) before the cable is wound. Because each strand is preformed, the
cable does not spread out when it is cut.
preheating (engine operation). The heating of an aircraft engine, battery and
cockpit instruments prior to start up in cold weather operations.
preignition (reciprocating engine malfunction). Ignition of the fuel-air mixture
inside the cylinder of an engine before the normal spark occurs. Preignition can
be caused by an incandescent piece of carbon or by any other sharp edge or point
inside the cylinder that gets red-hot.
preoiling (engine installation). A step in the installation of a new or overhauled
engine in an aircraft. Lubricating oil is pumped through the oil passages in the
engine, so all the bearing surfaces will be flooded with oil when the engine
starts.
preparation (in teaching/learning process). The first step of the teaching process,
consisting of determining the lesson’s scope, objectives, and goals to be attained.
This portion also includes making certain all necessary supplies are on hand.
When using the telling-and-doing technique of flight instruction, this step is
accomplished prior to the flight lesson.
prepreg (preimpregnated fabric). A type of composite material in which the
reinforcing fibers are encapsulated in an uncured resin. Prepreg must be kept
refrigerated to prevent the resin curing before it is used. Prepreg materials are cut
to size and shape and laid up with the correct ply orientation, and the entire
component is cured with heat and pressure.
preprogrammed course reversal. A course reversal (commonly called a
“procedure turn”) that appears as part of an instrument approach procedure that

has been loaded into the FMS/RNAV. Many FMS/RNAV units automatically
attempt to perform the course reversal procedure when it is encountered. Others
require the pilot to manually navigate the depicted procedural track or to use the
heading mode to fly the depicted track.
preprogrammed holding pattern (preprogrammed hold). A hold that is published
as part of an instrument procedure (e.g., approach, missed approach) that has
been loaded into the FMS/RNAV. Some FMS/RNAV units automatically enter
and fly the holding procedure when it is encountered. Others must be flown
around the depicted holding pattern, usually by changing the heading (bug).
Some units require switching to the nonsequencing (OBS) mode so the active
waypoint remains set to the designated holding fix.
prerotation (gyroplane operation). The spinning of the rotor to a sufficient rpm
prior to flight.
presentation (in teaching/learning process). The second step of the teaching
process, which consists of delivering information or demonstrating the skills that
make up the lesson. The delivery could be by either the lecture method or
demonstration-performance method. In the telling-and-doing technique of flight
instruction, this is the segment in which the instructor both talks about and
performs the procedure.
press brake (production sheet-metal tool). A form of sheet-metal bending tool in
which a long, straight male die whose bottom edge has the correct bend radius is
pressed down onto a sheet of metal placed over a female die containing a long
V-shaped groove. The male die is usually forced down by energy stored in a
large flywheel.

Pressure is normally expressed in such terms as pounds per square inch or grams
per square centimeter.

pressure altimeter. Another name for a pneumatic altimeter. See pneumatic
altimeter.
pressure altitude. The altitude in standard atmosphere at which the pressure is
the same as the existing pressure. Because a pneumatic altimeter operates solely
on pressure, pressure altitude is the uncorrected altitude indicated by an altimeter
when its barometric scale is adjusted to standard sea-level pressure of 29.92
inches of mercury, or 1013.2 millibars.
pressure carburetor (reciprocating engine component). A fuel metering device
that meters fuel to a reciprocating engine on the basis of the mass of air flowing
into the engine. The pressure forcing the fuel through the metering jet is
determined by the difference between two air-metering forces: the low pressure
produced at the throat of a venturi, and the high pressure of the air as it rams into
the carburetor. These two air pressures act on a diaphragm to control a fuel
pressure regulating system that varies the pressure drop across the fuel metering
jet as a function of the mass of air flowing into the engine.
pressure casting. A method of casting metal parts in which molten or plastic
metal is forced into permanent molds under pressure.
pressure cooling (reciprocating engine cooling). A method of air-cooling an
engine in which the cylinders are enclosed in tight-fitting shrouds. The cowling
is divided into two compartments by baffles and seals, with half of each cylinder
in each compartment. Ram air is directed into one compartment, and the pressure
in the other is decreased by air flowing over a flared exit or adjustable cowl
flaps. The pressure difference across the cylinders causes cooling air to be drawn
through the fins to remove the unwanted heat.
pressure-demand oxygen system. A type of oxygen system used by aircraft that
fly at very high altitude. This system functions as a diluter-demand system
below about 40,000 feet. Above this altitude, the regulator furnishes the mask
with 100% oxygen under pressure to force the oxygen into the lungs, rather than
depending on the low pressure produced when the wearer of the mask inhales to
pull in the oxygen. See diluter-demand oxygen system.
pressure-fed spray gun (paint spraying device). A paint spray gun in which the
material being sprayed is fed to the gun under pressure from a pressure pot or
pressure cup. Pressure-fed spray guns are used when a large quantity of material

is to be sprayed, or when the material is too heavy or too viscous to be picked up
by a suction-fed spray gun.
pressure fueling (aircraft fueling). The method of fueling used by almost all
transport aircraft. The fuel is put into the aircraft through a single underwing
fueling port. The fuel tanks are filled to the desired quantity and in the sequence
selected by the person conducting the fueling operation. Pressure fueling saves
servicing time by using a single point to fuel the entire aircraft, and it reduces the
chances for fuel contamination.

distance at a fixed time.
pressure gradient force (meteorology). Pressure differences that create a force
which drives the wind.
pressure-injection carburetor (reciprocating engine fuel metering device). A

metered on the basis of the mass of the air flowing into the engine and is sprayed
under pressure into the eye, or center, of the internal supercharger impeller.
pressure jump (meteorology). A sudden significant increase in station pressure.
pressure manifold (fluid power system component). The portion of a fluid power
system from which the selector valves receive their pressurized fluid.
pressure plate (aircraft disk brake component). A strong, heavy plate used in
multiple-disk brakes that receives the force from the brake cylinders and changes
it into a squeezing action on the brake disks to produce the friction that slows the
aircraft when the brakes are applied.
pressure pot (paint spray equipment). A container that holds the paint material to
be sprayed under a controlled air pressure. The material is forced by the air
pressure to the spray gun, where it is mixed with atomizing air and sprayed onto
the surface being painted.
pressure ratio controller (turbosupercharger control). The control in a
turbosupercharger system that works in parallel with the absolute pressure
controller to maintain a specified upper deck pressure after the engine has
reached its critical altitude.

power system that reduces the pressure of a liquid or gas from a high value to a
fixed lower value.
pressure regulator (fluid power system component). A control valve in a fluid
power system that reduces the pressure of a liquid or gas from a high value to a
lower value that can be adjusted by the operator. After being set, the output
pressure remains constant as the input pressure changes, within limits.
pressure relief valve (fluid power system component). A valve that relieves all
pressure above a given amount. In a hydraulic system, the pressure is relieved
back to the inlet side of the pump, and in a pneumatic system, it is relieved to the
outside air.

pressure relief valve (oxygen system component). A valve in an oxygen system
that relieves the pressure if the pressure reducing valve should fail.
pressure switch. A switch used to turn an electrical device on or off when a
specified fluid pressure is reached. Some hydraulic systems have a pressure
switch that senses the hydraulic system pressure. When the pressure drops to a
low value, called the cut-in pressure, the switch closes and turns the hydraulic
pump on. When the pump brings the pressure up to a higher value, called the
cut-out pressure, the pressure switch turns the pump off.

pressure transducer. A type of pressure measuring device that produces an
electrical signal proportional to the pressure being measured.
pressure vessel (aircraft structure). The portion of the structure of a pressurized
aircraft that is sealed and pressurized in flight. Normally, only the area housing
the occupants and some of the baggage areas are included in the pressure vessel.
pressurization. A form of climate control of an aircraft. An air compressor
increases the pressure of the air inside the cabin of a high-flying aircraft to a
value that allows the occupants to breathe normally. Without pressurization,
supplemental oxygen would be needed when flying above an altitude of about
10,000 feet.
pressurization controller (cabin pressurization system component). The
component in a cabin pressurization system that allows the flight crew to select
the desired cabin altitude and cabin rate of climb. The cabin altitude increases
until the maximum allowable pressure differential between cabin and ambient
pressure is reached, then the controller maintains this differential as the aircraft
altitude continues to increase.
pressurized aircraft. An aircraft in which the cabin area is sealed off and
pressurized with air from a cabin supercharger. Passengers and crew need
supplemental oxygen when the air pressure gets much below that found at an
altitude of about 10,000 feet.
To preclude the need of supplemental oxygen when flying at high altitude, the
air pressure in the cabin can be increased to a pressure that compares with an
altitude of about six to eight thousand feet. Humans are comfortable at this
pressure.
pressurized ignition system (aircraft reciprocating engine). A type of ignition
system used on reciprocating engines of aircraft that fly at high altitude. The low
air pressure at high altitude allows the high voltage inside an unpressurized
distributor to jump to the wrong electrode. To prevent this, the distributor can be
pressurized with compressed air from the engine supercharger. This higherdensity air is a good enough insulator to prevent the high voltage from jumping
to the wrong electrode.
pressurizing and dump valve (turbine engine fuel system component). A valve
used in a turbine engine fuel system equipped with duplex fuel nozzles. When
the demand for fuel is low, fuel flows through the primary manifold, but when

the demand is high, the pressurizing valve opens and directs fuel into the
secondary fuel manifold as well. When the engine is shut down, the dump valve
drains the fuel from the manifolds. See duplex fuel nozzles.
prestretching (control cable manufacturing process). A step in the manufacture
of aircraft control cable assemblies. After the terminals are installed on the
cables, a load of 60% of the cable breaking strength is applied and held for a
specified length of time. Prestretching prepares the cable for installation in the
aircraft.
pretest (psychology). A criterion-referenced test constructed to measure the
knowledge and skills that are necessary to begin the course. Pretests also may be
used to determine the student’s current level of knowledge and skill in relation to
the material that will be presented in the course. The pretest measures whether or
not the student has the prerequisite knowledge and skills necessary to proceed
with the course of instruction.

atmosphere, centered over the middle latitudes of both hemispheres.
prevailing wind (meteorology). The direction from which the wind blows most
frequently.
preventive maintenance. Maintenance procedures followed to keep a piece of
equipment working properly. Changing the oil, cleaning the spark plugs,
cleaning the fuel and oil strainers, and checking or replacing hose connections
are examples of reciprocating engine preventive maintenance. 14 CFR Part 1:
“Simple or minor preservation operations and the replacement of small standard
parts not involving complex assembly operations.”
prick punch. A sharp-pointed punch used to mark a location when laying out
metal parts. A prick punch makes only a small mark on the surface of the metal,

just large enough to accurately position a center punch.

primacy. A principle of learning in which the first experience of something often
creates a strong, almost unshakable impression. The importance to an instructor
is that the first time something is demonstrated, it must be shown correctly since
that experience is the one most likely to be remembered by the student.

it must be replaced when it becomes discharged. A carbon-zinc battery, such as
used in a flashlight, is an example of a primary cell.
primary circuit (magneto ignition system). The circuit in a magneto ignition
system in which the primary current flows. Primary current is produced when
lines of flux from the rotating magnet cut across the turns of wire in the primary
winding of the magneto coil. At the instant the primary current is greatest, a set
of breaker points opens the circuit and the flow stops immediately. The magnetic
field caused by the primary current collapses, cuts across the many turns of wire
in the secondary winding of the coil, which is wound around the primary
winding, and induces a high voltage in it.
The primary circuit includes the primary winding of the coil, the breaker
points, a condenser, and an ignition switch. The breaker points, condenser, and
switch are in parallel with each other and in series with the coil.
primary flight controls (aircraft controls). The flight controls that cause an
aircraft to rotate about its three axes. In an airplane, the primary flight controls

minor roughness of the surface being finished.
priming pump (fuel system component). A small hand-operated pump, normally
mounted on the instrument panel, that allows the pilot to pump a small amount
of gasoline directly into the intake manifold near the cylinder heads. This
provides a rich mixture for starting the engine.

and operators for compensation or hire to work directly with the companies to
coordinate FAA operating approval.
printed circuit (PC). An electrical circuit in which the conductors joining the
components are made of conductive strips bonded onto the surface of an
insulating board. A thin sheet of copper or other conducting material is bonded
to a sheet of fiberglass-reinforced resin, and the desired pattern of conductors is
drawn on the copper. All of the unwanted copper is chemically etched away, and

only the desired conductors are left. The component leads are assembled through
holes in the PC board and soldered to the copper conductors. PCs have almost
completely replaced the older point-to-point wired circuits.
print tolerance (aircraft drawings). A general tolerance that can be applied to
parts where the dimensions are not critical. Where a tolerance is not shown on a
dimension line, the print tolerance applies.
priority valve (fluid power system component). A type of flow-control valve
used in a fluid power system that causes the components to operate in the correct

problems encountered in real life, which forces students to reach real-world
solutions.
procedure turn (air traffic control). The maneuver prescribed when it is
necessary to reverse direction to establish an aircraft on the intermediate
approach segment or final approach course. The outbound course, direction of
turn, distance within which the turn must be completed, and minimum altitude
are specified in the procedure. However, unless otherwise restricted, the point at
which the turn may be commenced and the type and rate of turn are left to the
discretion of the pilot.

reversal has been completed and an aircraft is established inbound on the
intermediate approach segment or final approach course. A report of “procedure
turn inbound” is normally used by ATC as a position report for separation
purposes.

nonprecision instrument approach. The profile descent normally terminates at
the approach gate where the glideslope or other appropriate minimum altitude is
intercepted.
profile drag (aerodynamic drag). Aerodynamic drag caused by friction between
the air and the surfaces of an aircraft over which it is flowing. Profile drag is one
of the forms of parasite drag.
profile tip (turbine engine compressor blade tip). An axial-flow compressor
blade whose tip thickness is reduced to give it a higher resonant frequency so it
will not be subject to the vibrations that would affect a blade with a squared tip.
The profile tip also provides a more aerodynamically efficient shape for the
high-velocity air that is moved by the blade. Profile tips often touch the housing
and make a squealing noise as the engine is shut down. For this reason, profile
tips are sometimes called squealer tips.
profile view. Side view of an IAP chart illustrating the vertical approach path
altitudes, headings, distances, and fixes.
profilometer. A precision measuring instrument used to measure the depth of the

obstacle avoidance.
prony brake. An instrument used to measure the amount of horsepower an
engine or motor is delivering to its output shaft. The engine is operated at a

or push an airplane through the air. 14 CFR Part 1: “A device for propelling an
aircraft that has blades on an engine-driven shaft and that, when rotated,
produces by its action on the air, a thrust approximately perpendicular to its
plane of rotation. It includes control components normally supplied by its
manufacturer, but does not include main and auxiliary rotors or rotating airfoils
of engines.”

propeller brake. A friction brake used on some free-turbine turboprop engines to
prevent the propeller windmilling in flight after it has been feathered and to
prevent it from rotating when the engine is ground idling.
propeller cones. Tapered metal cones placed over a splined propeller shaft to
hold the propeller centered on the shaft. A single-piece bronze cone is used as
the rear cone and it slips over the shaft and contacts the thrust bearing retainer
nut that is screwed onto the propeller shaft. The front cone is a two-piece,
chrome-plated steel, matched set. It contains a groove into which a flange on the
propeller retaining nut fits. When the retaining nut is tightened, the propeller hub
is squeezed between the two cones which centers it on the shaft.

settings or helicopter rotor speeds can cause the VOR course deviation indicator
(CDI) to fluctuate as much as ±6°. Slight changes to the RPM setting will
normally smooth out this roughness.
propeller shaft. The shaft on which the propeller is mounted. On a direct-drive
engine, the propeller mounts on the end of the engine crankshaft. On a geared
engine, the propeller is mounted on a separate shaft which is part of the
reduction gear system. Before and during World War II tapered shafts were used
on most of the smaller engines and splined shafts were used on all of the larger
engines. Almost all modern engines except some of the very largest turboprop
engines are equipped with flanged propeller shafts.

propeller slip. The difference between the geometric pitch of the propeller and
its effective pitch. See propeller effective pitch, propeller geometric pitch.
propeller synchronization. The function of keeping the RPM of all the engines in
a multiengine aircraft exactly the same. One engine is used as the master engine,
and the speed of each of the other engines, called slave engines, is compared to
it. The propeller governor on each slave engine is automatically adjusted, to

change the pitch of its propeller to maintain an RPM the same as that of the
master engine.
propeller thrust. The forward aerodynamic force produced by a propeller as it
accelerates a large mass of air rearward.

C/D.
proportional control. A type of control in which the magnitude of the corrective
action (the output) is directly proportional to the magnitude of the error (the
input signal). An autopilot controls an airplane by proportional control. If a wing
drops slightly (the error), the autopilot servo causes the proper aileron movement
to smoothly return the aircraft to level flight.
proposed boundary crossing time (PBCT) (ATC term). Each center has a PBCT
parameter for each internal airport. Proposed internal flight plans are transmitted
to the adjacent center if the flight time along the proposed route from the
departure airport to the center boundary is less than or equal to the value of
PBCT or if airport adaptation specifies transmission regardless of PBCT.
proposed departure time (air traffic control). The time a scheduled flight will
depart the gate for scheduled operators, or the actual runway-off time for
nonscheduled operators. For expected departure clearance time (EDCT)
purposes, the air traffic control system command center (ATCSCC) adjusts the
proposed departure time for scheduled operators to reflect the runway-off time.
propulsive efficiency. A measure of the effectiveness with which an aircraft
engine converts the fuel it burns into useful thrust, and is the ratio of the thrust
horsepower produced by a propeller to the torque horsepower of the shaft
turning the propeller. The more nearly the speed of the aircraft is to the speed of
the exhaust jet or propeller wake, the less kinetic energy is lost in the jet or
wake, and the higher the propulsive efficiency.

generator, the quill shaft absorbs the load by twisting. This prevents the load
being applied to the gear train of the engine as a sudden shock.

quill shaft (torsional vibration damper). A form of torsional vibration damper
used between the engine crankshaft and the propeller reduction gears. The quill
shaft is a hardened steel shaft with splines on both ends. One end splines into the

rather than sharp, as they are in a coin-dimpled hole.
radius gage. A precision measuring tool consisting of a number of thin steel
blades used to find the radius of a curved surface. Each blade is shaped with an
inside and an outside radius of a specific size with the radius of the curve

usually specified by latitude, longitude, and altitude, where an unmanned aircraft
(UA) will attempt to return as part of fail-safe procedures when returning to the

home position is inadvisable. Rally points are usually used when the UA is
operating at great distance from the home position. They are placed where a lost

may safely execute an auto-landing, if necessary, without threat of danger to
other aircraft, personnel on the ground, or itself.

fuel accelerates the air and produces a forward thrust. Ramjet engines are used in
some military unmanned aircraft that are initially boosted to a speed high enough
for the engine to function.

hangars where aircraft can be parked. Most ramps have provision for securing
aircraft so they will not be blown away by strong winds. Ramps are also called
aprons and tarmacs.
ramping (seaplane operation). The use of a ramp that extends under the water
surface as a means of getting the seaplane out of the water and onto the shore.
The seaplane is typically driven under power onto the ramp, and slides partway

cross-section of targets along a selected azimuth.
range markings. Colored marks on an aircraft instrument dial that identify
certain ranges of operation as specified in the aircraft maintenance or flight
manual and listed in the appropriate aircraft Type Certificate Data Sheets or
Aircraft Specifications. Color-coding directs attention to approaching operating
difficulties. These ranges and colors are the most generally used:
Red radial line—do not exceed.

wood. A rasp has individual cutting points, rather than lines of teeth, as on a file.
ratchet. A device that allows rotation of a wheel or handle in one direction, but
prevents its turning in the opposite direction. A ratchet assembly consists of a
toothed wheel and a pawl. The pawl is a lever that rides over the teeth when the
wheel is turned in one direction, but engages the teeth to prevent the wheel
turning in the opposite direction. Most ratchets have a method of reversing the
pawl so the ratchet will work in either direction.
ratchet coupling. A coupling between two rotating shafts that allows one shaft to
drive the other, but will not allow the driven shaft to rotate the drive shaft.
ratchet handle (mechanic’s hand tool). A handle that has a ratchet built into its
head, and used to drive a socket wrench. Back-and-forth movement of the handle
causes the socket to rotate in one direction. By reversing the pawl in the ratchet
head, the same back-and-forth movement of the handle will rotate the socket in
the opposite direction.

rate gyro. An instrument which measures the rate of rotation of an object about
an axis. A spinning gyroscope precesses, or tilts, when it is rotated in a plane at
right angles to its own spin axis. The amount the gyroscope tilts is proportional
to the rate at which it is rotated about an axis at right angles to both its spin axis
and the axis of its precession (the axis about which it tilts). Rate gyros are used
in turn and slip indicators and turn coordinators.

rate-of-climb indicator (aircraft instrument). An instrument used to show the
pilot the rate at which the aircraft is climbing or descending. A rate-of-climb
indicator is a pressure instrument that compares the pressures inside and outside
a metal capsule inside the instrument case. Static pressure is directed into the
instrument case and also into the capsule, but to get into the capsule, the air must
flow through a calibrated orifice (a tiny hole of a specific size).
When the aircraft is not changing altitude, the pressure inside the capsule is the
same as that inside the instrument case. But when the aircraft is climbing or
descending, the orifice causes the pressure inside the capsule to change more
slowly than the pressure inside the case. This lag in the pressure change causes
the capsule to expand or collapse until the pressure equalizes. The amount of
expansion or collapse is measured, and it indicates on the instrument dial as the
number of feet-per-minute climb or descent. Rate-of-climb indicators are also
called vertical-speed indicators.
rate-of-temperature-rise fire detector. A type of fire detection system that uses a
series of thermocouples to detect a fire condition by the rate at which the

temperature being monitored rises. A series of thermocouples is placed in the
area being protected, and a reference thermocouple in the area is insulated so its
temperature always changes slowly. When the overall temperature rise is slow
enough that the insulated thermocouple remains at the same temperature as the
measuring thermocouples, no signal is sent to the fire warning system. But if a
fire occurs and the measuring thermocouple gets hot before the insulated
reference thermocouple, a voltage is produced that causes a current to flow and
actuate the fire warning system.
rate of turn. The amount of time it takes for an aircraft to turn a specified number
of degrees.

located at the point the bearings from all of the RDF stations cross.
reach (spark plug design feature). The length of the threads on a spark plug shell.
The reach needed by a spark plug is determined by the thickness of the cylinder
head into which the spark plug screws. The end of the spark plug should be flush

with the inside of the cylinder head. A long-reach 18-mm aircraft spark plug has
a reach of 13 ⁄16-inch; a short-reach 18-mm spark plug has a reach of 1 ⁄2-inch.

reactance (X). Opposition to the flow of alternating current caused by
capacitance and inductance in the circuit. Reactance opposes the flow of
alternating current without using any power.
Reactance caused by capacitance is called capacitive reactance, its symbol is
XC, and it is measured in ohms. Capacitive reactance causes the current in the
circuit to lead the voltage.
Reactance caused by inductance is called inductive reactance, and its symbol is
XL. Inductive reactance is also measured in ohms, and it causes the current in a
circuit to lag behind the voltage.
reaction. A response to an action that occurs in a direction opposite to the action.
The recoil produced when a gun is fired is an example of reaction. When the
powder in the cartridge burns, the resulting gas forces the bullet out the barrel.

pushes back on the gun with exactly the same amount of force.
reaction engine. A form of heat engine that produces thrust by heating a mass of
air inside the engine and discharging it at a high velocity through a specially
shaped nozzle. The amount of thrust is determined by the mass of the air and by
the amount it is accelerated. Reaction engines which include rocket engines are
commonly called jet engines.
reaction turbine. A type of turbine wheel turned by an aerodynamic force
produced by the turbine blades. This force is similar to the lift produced by an
aircraft wing. The blades of a reaction turbine are small airfoils mounted on the
periphery of the turbine wheel in such a way that they form converging ducts
that accelerate the hot gases passing through them. The high-velocity gas

flowing over the reaction turbine blades produces a pressure difference between
the top and bottom of the blade. This pressure difference produces a force which
rotates the turbine wheel.

circuit that is not in phase with the voltage.
reactive metal. A metal that reacts readily with oxygen to form an oxide.
Aluminum and magnesium are both reactive metals.
reactive power (electrical power). Wattless power in an alternating current
circuit. Reactive power, the power consumed in the inductive and capacitive
reactances in the circuit, is expressed in volt-amps reactive (VAR) or in kilovoltamps reactive (KVAR).
reactor (electrical circuit). A small coil installed in an alternating current circuit
to furnish inductive reactance to cancel some of the capacitive reactance in the
circuit. Reactors normally have very little resistance.

maintains that the eagerness and single-mindedness of a person toward learning
affect the outcome of the learning experience.

total voltage and the total current, by the power factor, the percent of the total
current in phase with the circuit voltage.

the inside of a drilled hole. A reamer has several sharp cutting edges that cut
away the rough surface left by the drill.
rebreather oxygen mask. A type of mask used with a continuous-flow oxygen
system. Oxygen continuously flows into the bottom of the loose-fitting
rebreather bag on the mask, and the wearer of the mask exhales into the top of
the bag. The first air exhaled contains some oxygen, and this air goes into the
bag first. The last air to leave the lungs contains little oxygen, and it is forced out
as the bag is filled with fresh oxygen. Each time the wearer of the mask inhales,
the air first exhaled, along with fresh oxygen, is taken back into the lungs, or
rebreathed.
rebuilt engine. A used engine that has been completely disassembled, inspected,
repaired as necessary, reassembled, tested, and approved in the same manner and
to the same tolerances and limits as a new engine, using either new or used parts.
The parts used in a rebuilt engine must conform to all production drawings,
tolerances, and limits for new parts or be of approved oversize or undersize
dimensions allowed for a new engine.
According to 14 CFR §91.421, a rebuilt engine is considered to have no
previous operating history and may be issued a zero-time logbook. Only the
engine manufacturer or an agent approved by the manufacturer can rebuild an
engine and issue a zero-time record.

is 090° (the heading in the opposite direction). The reciprocal of a number is the
number one, divided by the number. The reciprocal of two is one-half, one
divided by two (1 ÷ 2 or 1 ⁄2).
reciprocating engine. A type of heat engine that changes chemical energy in fuel
and air into mechanical energy. A mixture of fuel and air is drawn into a cylinder
as a close-fitting piston moves downward.
The valve through which the fuel-air mixture entered the cylinder closes, and
the piston moves up, compressing the mixture. As the piston nears the top of its
stroke, the compressed mixture is ignited, and it burns. The burning gases heat
the air in the cylinder, and as it expands, it pushes the piston downward.
The reciprocating piston is connected to a crankshaft throw by a connecting rod.
As the piston moves up and down in the cylinder, the connecting rod rotates the
crankshaft.

shown on an ASI that indicates the “never-exceed speed” (or VNE); it can also
refer to any limit-line on instrument gauges that cautions against going beyond
the “red line” indication.
In balloon operations: also called the “vent line,” this refers to the rope line
(usually red-colored) that controls the functioning of the deflation port (or
parachute valve) to release a controlled amount of hot air from the top of a
balloon envelope; it may also refer to the limit-line on the envelope temperature
gauge (or pyrometer) that indicates “maximum envelope temperature allowed.”
red-line condition. A maximum allowable condition. This term is derived from
the fact that the maximum allowable condition is normally marked on an
indicating instrument with a red radial line. Airspeed, engine RPM, and various
engine temperatures all have specified red-line conditions.

straight sides, and the bottom of the recess is a sharp V.

reed valve. A simple check valve that allows fluid to flow in one direction, but
blocks its flow in the opposite direction. The reed is a flat piece of flexible
material, often spring steel, fastened by one of its edges to one side of a hole.
Fluid flowing from the side of the hole opposite the reed forces it off its seat, and
the fluid flows through the hole. When fluid tries to flow through the hole from
the side on which the reed is mounted, it forces the reed tightly against the hole,
and no fluid can flow. Reed valves are used in some types of simple air
compressors and pulse jet engines.
reenter, or reentry. 14 CFR §401.5: “To return or attempt to return,
purposefully, a reentry vehicle and its payload, if any, from Earth orbit or from
outer space to Earth. The term ‘reenter; reentry’ includes activities conducted in
Earth orbit or outer space to determine reentry readiness and that are critical to

ensuring public health and safety and the safety of property during reentry flight.
… also includes activities conducted on the ground after vehicle landing on
Earth to ensure the reentry vehicle does not pose a threat to public health and
safety or the safety of property.”

system to absorb heat, then carry it to another location where it is given up to the
outside air.

refrigerant-12. The refrigerant that was formerly widely used in aircraft vaporcycle air cooling systems. Refrigerant-12 (R-12) is the name generally used for
dichlorodifluoromethane, which is sold under such registered trade names as
Freon-12, Genetron-12, and Ucon-12. R-12 is being replaced by R-134a, which
is more environmentally friendly.
regeneration (electronic amplification). A method of increasing the gain of an
amplifier by feeding part of the amplified signal back into its input in phase with

oscillate and produce an unwanted signal, often in the form of a whistle, or
squeal. Regeneration is also called regenerative feedback or positive feedback.
regenerative braking (electrical braking). A method of slowing the rotating
armature of an electric motor. When the brake control switch is moved to the
STOP position, it removes power from the motor and connects the armature
across an electrical load. As long as the armature is rotating, it produces
electrical current, and power is required to force this current through the load.
This power taken from the rotating armature causes it to slow down.
regional airline. A commuter airline that serves smaller cities and brings
passengers to larger hub airlines.
region of reverse command (flight condition). Flight at an airspeed, or angle of
attack, lower than that which produces the maximum endurance. Below this
speed, an increase in power will actually result in a lower airspeed. This is
generally known as “flying behind the power curve.” Decreasing the angle of
attack allows the airspeed to increase without increasing the power or thrust.

the relationship between speed and the power required to maintain or change that
speed in flight.

or by using additional material.
reinforced shell. See semimonocoque structure.
reinforcing tape (aircraft fabric covering component). A narrow strip of woven
fabric material placed over the fabric at the points it is being attached to the
aircraft structure with ribstitching cord. The reinforcing tape carries a large
amount of the load and prevents the fabric from tearing at the stitches.
rejuvenation (aircraft finishes). The process of restoring resilience to an old dope
film on a fabric-covered aircraft. When aircraft dope is exposed to the sun for
several years, the plasticizers migrate from it, and the dope film become brittle
and cracks. Rejuvenator, which is a mixture of strong solvents and plasticizer, is
sprayed over the old dope. The solvents penetrate the dope, and the plasticizer
restores resilience to the dope film.
rejuvenator (aircraft finishing material). A finishing material used to restore
resilience to an old dope film. Rejuvenator contains strong solvents to open up
the dried-out dope film and plasticizers to restore resilience to the old dope.
relative (or resultant) airflow (RAF) (helicopter aerodynamics). The velocity
vector of the airflow approaching the blades. The relative airflow is dependent
on a number of component flows, e.g., induced flow, flow due to rotor rpm, and
others.

disregarding the component of vorticity resulting from the earth’s rotation.
relative wind. The direction the wind strikes an airfoil.
relaxation oscillator. A type of electronic oscillator that changes direct current
into pulsating DC with a sawtooth waveform. A capacitor is charged through a
resistor to produce a slow rise in voltage. At a specified voltage, the gas in a gasfilled electron tube becomes ionized and conducts. The capacitor immediately
discharges through this ionized gas.
The frequency of oscillation is determined by the values of the capacitor and
the resistor and by the ionization voltage of the gas in the tube. See sawtooth
waveform.

relay (electrical component). An electrically operated switch. One switch contact
is mounted on a movable steel arm, the armature, which is held away from the
fixed contact by a spring. When current flows through the electromagnetic coil
of the relay, it pulls the armature down and causes the movable contact to press
tightly against the fixed contact, closing the switch.

Relays are used to remotely control a large amount of current by using a small
amount of control current flowing through the relay coil. Relays are being
replaced in many types of electrical equipment with solid-state components that
do the same job, but have no moving parts.

reliability. The ability of an aircraft engine to perform its designed functions
under widely varying operating conditions.
relief hole (sheet metal fabrication). A hole drilled at the point at which two
bend lines meet in a piece of sheet metal. When a piece of sheet metal is formed
into a pan, a square is cut from the corners of the sheet, and the sides are bent
upward. The metal where the two bends meet will usually buckle and crack. To
prevent this cracking, a relief hole whose diameter is approximately twice the
radius of the bend is drilled at the point the two bends meet. This relief hole
spreads the stresses so the metal does not crack.
relief map. A three-dimensional map in which mountains and valleys are formed
so they show the way the land actually looks.
relief tube. A urinal installed in some special-purpose aircraft.
relief valve. A pressure-control valve that relieves any pressure over the amount
for which it is set. Pressure relief valves are used in both hydraulic and

pneumatic systems to prevent damaging high pressures that could be caused by a
malfunctioning pressure regulator, or by thermal expansion of fluid trapped in
portions of the system.
reluctance. Opposition to the passage of lines of magnetic flux through a
material. Reluctance in a magnetic circuit compares with resistance in an
electrical circuit.

number is subtracted from another. The remainder is also the number left in a
division problem when the divisor does not go into the dividend an even number
of times.
remanufactured engine. An aircraft engine that has been completely rebuilt by
the original engine manufacturer or by a facility approved by them. A
remanufactured engine is considered to be a zero-time engine and is usually

instruments, or manual observation available to the AFSS specialist.
remote airport information service (RAIS). A temporary service provided by
facilities not located on the landing airport, but which have communication
capability and automated weather reporting available to the pilot at the landing
airport.

remotely controlled by air traffic personnel. RCOs serve flight service stations.
Also called a remote transmitted receiver (RTR) when serving a terminal ATC
facility. An RCO or RTR may be UHF or VHF and will extend the
communication range of the air traffic facility.

device being controlled. Remote control can be accomplished by fluid power, by
electrical current carried through wires, or by signals transmitted by radio or
light.

station or airline. The repairman certificate (license) is valid only as long as the
repairman is employed by the company for which the certificate was issued.
Repair Station. A certificated maintenance facility approved by the FAA to
perform certain specific maintenance functions. These facilities are certificated
under 14 CFR Part 145.
repeating decimal (mathematics). The decimal equivalent of a fraction in which
the denominator does not go into the numerator an even number of times. The
fraction 1 ⁄3 gives a repeating decimal: 0.3333333… .

uncomfortable thoughts, or things he or she can’t cope with, into inaccessible
areas of the unconscious mind. In Freudian theory, some forgetting of learned
information is caused by repression. A person is more likely to forget
information that is unpleasant or produces anxiety.
repulsion. A mechanical force that tries to move objects apart. There is a force of
repulsion between like magnetic poles, between electrical charges of the same
polarity, and between parallel wires carrying current in the same direction.
repulsion motor (electric motor). A type of AC motor in which the source
current is supplied to the stator winding, and current is induced into the rotor
windings. The rotor windings end at copper bars on a commutator, and brushes
pick up rotor current. The brushes are connected together so they short-circuit
some of the rotor windings.
Rotor current flowing through the short-circuited coils produces a magnetic
field whose axis is at an angle to the magnetic field in the stator. Because the
two magnetic fields are at an angle to each other, they repel, or push away from,
each other.
The brushes of a repulsion motor are usually mounted on a control that allows
them to be rotated with reference to the stator field. Moving the brushes controls
the direction of rotation and the speed of a repulsion motor.

request full route clearance. A term used by pilots to request that the entire route
of flight be read verbatim in an ATC clearance. Such request should be made to
preclude receiving an ATC clearance based on the original filed flight plan when

a filed IFR flight plan has been revised by the pilot, company, or operations prior
to departure.
required equipment (aircraft equipment). Equipment required by the FAA to be
installed in an aircraft for it to be considered airworthy. All FAA-certificated
aircraft must carry an up-to-date equipment list, itemizing all of the required
equipment.
required navigation performance (RNP). A statement of the navigational
accuracy and performance necessary for operation within a defined airspace.
RNP requires that an aircraft flying through certain airspace navigate within
certain pre-set tolerances. RNP airspace is a generic term designating airspace,
route(s), leg(s), operation(s), or procedure(s) where minimum required
navigational performance (RNP) criteria have been established. RNP equipped
aircraft can fly to lower approach minimums, have greater confidence with
aircraft separation and fly repeatable curved course.

and manned to coordinate and control SAR operations in an area designated by
the SAR plan. The U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. Air Force have responsibility
for the operation of RCCs.
rescue co-ordination center (ICAO). A unit responsible for promoting efficient
organization of search and rescue service and for coordinating the conduct of
search and rescue operations within a search and rescue region.
reserve flightcrew member. A flightcrew member who is required by the
certificate holder to be available to receive an assignment for duty.
reservoir. A container in which liquid is stored. The tank in a hydraulic system is
called a reservoir because it stores fluid until it is needed to actuate some
component in the system.

actuation of a deicing system.

residual magnetic flux. The magnetic flux left in a piece of iron or steel after the
magnetizing force is reduced to zero. Soft iron can hold very little residual
magnetic flux, but hard steel and certain alloys hold a large amount of residual
magnetic flux.
residual magnetic particle inspection. A form of magnetic particle inspection for
small steel parts that have a high degree of retentivity. The part is magnetized,
then removed from and inspected away from the magnetizing machine.
residual magnetism (electric generator). The magnetism that remains in the field
frame of a generator when no current is flowing in the field coils. It is residual
magnetism that produces the initial current when a generator begins to turn. As
soon as the current produced by the residual magnetism begins to flow in the
field coils, the field strength increases and more current is produced.
residual risk (risk assessment, aeronautical decision making). Some types of
hazard or risk cannot be known, and are only identified subsequently when a
mishap occurs. In risk assessment, those risks that cannot be assessed as to their
manageability in flight or whether they can be reduced through prior action, end
up being passed on to the pilot (or the person attempting risk management for a
certain flight) as residual risk. (See also acceptable risk, unacceptable risk.)
residual voltage (generator voltage). The voltage produced in a generator
armature when there no current is flowing in the field windings. Residual
voltage is produced when the armature rotates in the permanent magnetism in
the generator field frame. If this permanent magnetism is lost and no residual
voltage is produced, it can be restored by flashing the field. See flashing the
field.
resilient sealant. A sealing compound that hardens to the consistency of rubber.
It does not get brittle.
resin (natural). A natural, translucent, solid or semisolid material, produced from

resin but lacks sufficient reinforcing fiber.
resin starved (composites). A localized area in a composite lay up that lacks

sufficient resin to thoroughly wet the reinforcing fiber.
resin transfer molding (RTM) (composites). A molding process in which
catalyzed resin is introduced into an enclosed mold into which the fiber
reinforcement has been placed. The cure is normally accomplished without
external heat. RTM combines relatively low tooling and equipment costs with
the ability to mold large structural parts.
resistance, R (electrical characteristic). The characteristic of an electrical circuit
that opposes the flow of electrons. When electrons flow through a resistance,
power is used, voltage is dropped, and, generally, heat is produced. The amount
of resistance in a circuit is measured in ohms, with one ohm being the amount of
resistance needed to produce a one-volt drop when one amp of current flows
through it.
resistance decade (electronic equipment). A piece of electronic test equipment
consisting of several precision resistors and selector switches. By connecting the
resistance decade into a circuit and setting the selector switches in the proper
positions, any required amount of resistance can be put into a circuit.
The resistance decade gets its name from the increments of resistance that can
be selected. One switch can select resistances between 0.0 ohm and 0.9 ohm, in
ten steps (a decade of steps) of 0.1 ohm each. The next switch can select
resistances between 1.0 and 9.0 ohms. The other switches can select between
10.0 and 90.0, 100.0 and 900.0, and 1,000 and 9,000 ohms. With five switches,
any amount of resistance between 0.1 ohm and 9,999.9 ohms can be put into a
circuit.
resistance furnace. A type of furnace used for making alloys of certain metals.
The heat that melts the metal is produced by passing a large amount of electrical
current through it.
resistance thermometer. A type of electrical temperature-measuring instrument
that uses a resistance bulb as its temperature-sensing element. The resistance
bulb contains a length of small diameter nickel wire, wound on a mica form and
enclosed in a thin stainless steel tube. The resistance of the nickel wire increases
as its temperature increases. The resistance bulb is installed in a Wheatstone
bridge circuit in such a way that current flowing through the indicating
instrument changes as the resistance of the bulb changes.

resistance welding. A form of electrical welding used for joining thin sheets of
metal. The metal to be welded is pressed together by the electrodes of the
welding machine, and low-voltage current is passed through the metal. Heat
caused by the current softens the metal, and pressure on the electrodes forces the
softened metal together. The current is stopped, but the pressure is held on the
electrodes until the softened metal hardens. Spot welding and seam welding are
types of resistance welding.
resistance wire. Wire made of such alloys as Manganin or Nichrome. This wire
has a high resistance and is used to make precision, wire-wound resistors and
electric heater elements.
resistive circuit (electrical circuit). An electrical circuit in which all of the
opposition to the flow of electrons is caused by circuit resistance. In a resistive
circuit, the current and voltage are in phase.
resistivity (electrical characteristic). The amount of resistance for a given volume
of material or for a given amount of surface area. Resistivity is the reciprocal
(the opposite) of conductivity.
resistor (electrical component). A component used to place a specific amount of
resistance in an electrical circuit.
resistor color code. A color code used to show the amount of resistance and the
resistance tolerance of a composition resistor. Three or four colored bands are
placed around one end of the resistor. The band nearest the end of the resistor
indicates the first significant digit in the resistance. The second band is for the
second significant digit. The third band shows the number of zeros to add to the
two significant digits. The fourth band shows the tolerance of the resistance in
percentage of the nominal value. See resistor color code illustration.

resistor spark plug (ignition system component). A shielded aircraft spark plug
with a built-in carbon resistor between its terminal end and center electrode.
Shielded ignition leads have a metal braid around the insulator, and this braid,
with the insulator and conductor, acts as a capacitor and stores electrical energy.
When the spark jumps the gap in the spark plug, the energy stored in the lead
capacity causes the spark to continue after the fuel is ignited. This prolonged
spark needlessly wears away the spark plug electrodes. The built-in resistor
causes enough opposition to this current to reduce the spark duration and
increase the life of the spark plug electrodes.
resolution (radar technology). The ability of radar to show discrete targets
separately. The better the resolution, the closer two targets can be to each other
and still be detected as separate targets.
resolution advisory (RA) (air traffic control). A display indication given to the
pilot by the traffic alert and collision avoidance system (TCAS II)
recommending a maneuver to increase vertical separation relative to an intruding
aircraft. Positive, negative, and vertical speed limit advisories constitute the
resolution advisories. A resolution advisory is also classified as corrective or
preventive.

resonance (electrical). The condition in an electrical circuit in which the
inductive reactance and the capacitive reactance are equal. The reactances are
determined by the frequency, and a circuit is resonant for a very narrow band of
frequencies.
resonance (mechanical). The frequency of vibration of a mechanical system or
device at which the vibration has the greatest displacement. The physical
dimensions of an object determine the frequency at which it is resonant.
resonance method of ultrasonic inspection. A method of nondestructive
inspection for internal faults in a piece of material. A pulse of ultrasonic energy
of known frequency and intensity is induced into the material, and the vibration
produced by this energy is displayed on an oscilloscope. There is a definite
change in the vibration pattern if the wave of energy passes over a fault within
the material.
resonant circuit (electrical circuit). A tuned electrical circuit that contains both
capacitance and inductance. By adjusting the amount of capacitance or
inductance, the circuit can be tuned (its resonant frequency can be changed).
resonant frequency (alternating current). The frequency of alternating current
that produces the same inductive reactance and capacitive reactance in a circuit.
Capacitive reactance decreases as the frequency increases, but the inductive
reactance increases with the frequency. At only one frequency, the resonant
frequency (Fr), the inductive reactance, and capacitive reactance are the same.
resonant frequency (mechanical vibration). The frequency at which a mechanical
object vibrates, or oscillates, with the maximum amplitude for the amount of
energy used to produce the vibration. The resonant frequency of an object is
sometimes called its natural frequency.

respirator. A device worn over the mouth and nose of a person working in an
atmosphere of dangerous gases or contaminated air. Some respirators supply
oxygen or clean air for the wearer, while others simply filter the contaminants
from the air.
response (in teaching/learning process). A possible answer to a multiple-choice
test item. The correct response is often called the keyed response, and incorrect
responses are called distractors.
restricted area. 14 CFR Part 1: “Airspace designated under Part 73 of this
chapter within which the flight of aircraft, while not wholly prohibited, is subject
to restriction.”
restricted area (ICAO). An airspace of defined dimensions, above the land areas
or territorial waters of a State, within which the flight of aircraft is restricted in
accordance with certain specified conditions.
restrictor (fluid-flow system component). An orifice installed in a fluid flow
system to decrease the amount of fluid allowed to flow under a specific amount
of pressure.

secondary winding of the magneto coil. Resultant flux is the combination of the
permanent magnet flux and the flux produced by current flowing in the primary
winding of the coil.
resultant relative wind. Airflow from rotation that is modified by induced flow.
resultant vector. A single vector which is the sum of two or more vectors.
“Resume normal speed” (air traffic control). A phrase used by ATC to advise
that previously issued speed control (controller assigned or as part of a published
procedure) restrictions are deleted. This statement does not relieve the pilot of
those speed restrictions which are applicable to 14 CFR §91.117.
“Resume own navigation” (air traffic control). A phrase used by ATC to advise a
pilot to resume his own navigation responsibility. This is issued after completion
of a radar vector or when radar contact is lost when the aircraft is being radar
vectored.
retard. To slow something down or cause it to operate later than it normally
does. In a reciprocating engine, the spark that ignites the fuel-air mixture inside

the cylinders must be timed so the burning gases produce the greatest amount of
push on the piston. When the engine is started, the pistons move slowly, and the
spark must be delayed until the pistons begin to move downward. The spark for
starting must be retarded.
retard breaker points (aircraft magneto component). An extra set of breaker
points installed in aircraft magnetos equipped with the “Shower of Sparks”
starting system. When the ignition switch is moved to the START position, a
second set of breaker points is connected in parallel with the normal breaker
points. These points open later than the normal points, and the spark does not
occur inside the cylinder until the engine has rotated far enough beyond its
normal firing position for these retard points to open.
retarded sparks. The timing of the firing of the spark plugs used to start a
reciprocating engine. The sparks for starting occur later in terms of crankshaft
rotation than those used for normal operation. Retarding the sparks prevent the
engine from kicking back when it is being started.
retarder (finishing system component). A special thinner used in some types of
finishing material, such as lacquer, to slow its drying time. When lacquer or
dope dries too fast, the evaporation of the solvents often drops the temperature of
the surrounding air enough that moisture condenses out of the air onto the wet
finish. This causes the finish to blush, or become dull and porous.
Retarder, added to the lacquer or dope before it is sprayed onto the surface,
keeps it from drying too fast. When it dries slowly, the temperature does not
drop enough to condense moisture out of the air.
retention in flight instruction (psychology). The ability to recall what has been
learned. There are five principles which are generally accepted as having a direct
application to remembering; praise, recall, favorable attitudes, learning with all
of the senses and meaningful repetition.
retentivity (magnetism). The ability of a magnetizable material to retain the
alignment of the magnetic domains after the magnetizing force has been
removed. Hard steel normally has a high retentivity, while soft iron and
electrical steel both have very low retentivity.
retort. A vessel used to distill a material. The material to be distilled is put into
the retort and boiled. Vapors from the boiling material are picked up from the

top of the retort and cooled enough for them to condense back into a liquid. The
liquid is collected from the retort in a suitable container.
retrace line (cathode-ray tube). The line followed by the beam of electrons in a
cathode-ray tube after it ends one line and returns to the start of the next line.
Retracing is also called flyback.
retract. To draw back or draw up. The landing gear of most modern airplanes can
be retracted, or drawn up into the wing or fuselage.
retractable landing gear (aircraft landing gear). The type of landing gear that can
be folded up into the structure when the aircraft is off the ground. A fixed
(nonretractable) landing gear produces a large amount of drag when the aircraft
is flying at a high speed. To reduce this drag, the landing gear is retracted, or
folded up into the structure.
retraction test (aircraft landing gear). A part of a 100-hour or annual inspection
of an aircraft. The aircraft is raised off the floor with jacks, and the retractable
landing gear is operated through its retraction and extension cycle. It is checked
for its operating time and for any indication of improper operation.
retread (tires). To apply new tread to a tire. The tread wears off most airplane
tires long before the tire carcass is damaged or worn out, so for economical
operation, the tire can be retreaded. The remaining tread is ground off and the
carcass inspected. If it is in good condition, a new tread can be put on and
vulcanized. A properly retreaded tire is as serviceable as a new tire, and it costs
much less.
retreating blade (helicopter rotor blade). The blade of a helicopter rotor moving
in the direction opposite to that in which the helicopter is flying. The blade on
the opposite side of the helicopter is called the advancing blade.
retreating blade stall. The stall of a helicopter rotor disc that occurs near the tip
of the retreating blade. A retreating blade stall occurs when the helicopter
airspeed is high and the retreating blade airspeed is low. This results in a high
angle of attack, which causes the stall.
retrofit. A part made by a manufacturer, to be installed on a device that is no
longer in production. If a new engine is developed that improves the
performance of an older aircraft, a retrofit can be made to install the new engine

on the older aircraft. When a retrofit part is produced, it is often sold as a kit
which includes the new part and all of the necessary hardware and instructions.
return manifold (fluid power system). The portion of a fluid power system
through which the fluid is returned to the reservoir.

to be easier to say than the civilian equivalents (RTL, return to land, or RTH,
return to home). Also can be used as a verb to indicate action; for example,
“RTB that aircraft,” or “that aircraft has been RTB’d.”
return to service (aircraft maintenance operation). An aircraft is returned to
service when it completes a test flight by an appropriately certified pilot. A
certificated mechanic or authorized inspector must approve an aircraft for return
to service after it has been inspected, repaired, or altered.

return to Earth substantially intact and therefore may be launched more than one
time or that contains vehicle stages that may be recovered by a launch operator
for future use in the operation of a substantially similar launch vehicle.”

valid for a definite length of time. After this time has lapsed, the holder of the
license or certificate must take some specified action or pass some type of test to
revalidate the license.
reverse-biased junction (semiconductor device). A voltage placed across the PN
junction in a semiconductor device, with the positive voltage connected to the Nmaterial and the negative voltage to the P-material. When the PN junction in a
diode or a transistor is reverse-biased, the depletion area is enlarged so electrons
cannot cross the junction to flow in the external circuit.
reverse current (semiconductor device). Current in a semiconductor device that
flows across a PN junction when the junction is reverse-biased. Reverse current
is the movement of minority carriers in the semiconductor material. Also called
leakage current, it increases with the temperature of the device.
reverse-current relay (generator control device). A normally open, magnetically

closed switch in the output circuit of a DC generator, between the generator and
the battery. When the generator voltage is lower than that of the battery, a spring
holds the reverse-current relay contacts open, and the generator is not connected
to the battery. As soon as the generator voltage rises above that of the battery, an
electromagnet in the relay closes the contacts and connects the generator to the
battery. The more current flowing from the generator to the battery, the tighter
the contacts are pulled together. When the generator voltage drops below that of
the battery, reverse current flows from the battery to the generator. When reverse
current flows, the magnetic field holding the contacts closed is cancelled, and a
spring pulls the relay contacts open. This disconnects the generator from the
battery. If a DC generator control circuit did not incorporate a reverse-current
relay, the battery would discharge through the generator when the generator
voltage was lower than that of the battery.
reverse-flow combustor (gas turbine engine component). A type of turbine
engine combustor in which the air flowing from the compressor follows an Sshaped pattern and enters the combustor at its rear end. As the air flows forward
through the combustor, fuel is sprayed into it and burned. The burning fuel heats
and expands the air. After the hot gases leave the combustor, they complete the
S-turn and flow rearward, through the turbine. Reverse-flow combustors allow
the engine to be shorter than it could be if straight-through combustors were
used.
reverse-polarity welding. DC electric arc welding in which the electrode is
positive with respect to the work.

can be moved to a pitch angle that produces reverse thrust. Reversible-pitch
propellers are used to decrease the length of the landing roll needed by the
airplane.
review and evaluation (in teaching/learning process). The fourth and last step in
the teaching process consisting of a review of all material and an evaluation of
the students. In the telling-and-doing technique of flight instruction, this step
consists of the instructor evaluating the student’s performance while the student
performs the required procedure.

Reynolds number (fluid mechanics). A dimensionless number used to determine
the flow characteristics of a fluid passing over a body. Reynolds number (RN) is
determined by the velocity of the fluid, the distance the fluid travels over the
body, and the kinematic viscosity of the fluid. Kinematic viscosity is the
absolute viscosity of the fluid divided by its density.

electromagnetic energy. Improperly filtered amateur radio transmitters, radio-

frequency electrical heaters, and certain types of medical equipment cause radiofrequency interference.
rheostat (electrical component). A variable resistor having two connections to
install it in a circuit. The resistance element of a rheostat is made either of wire
wound on a circular insulating card or of a carbon compound molded onto a
disk. A wiper moves across the resistance element to change the amount of
resistance put into the circuit. A rheostat is similar to a potentiometer except that
the potentiometer has three connections rather than two.

for a purpose other than to obtain a reply. It can be a question asked to stimulate
group thought. Normally answered by the instructor, rhetorical questions are
more commonly used in lecturing than in guided discussions.

right-hand rule for electric generators. The rule for determining the direction of
current flow in a wire passing through a magnetic field. Hold the right hand with
the thumb, first finger, and second finger extended so they are at right angles to
each other. When the first finger points in the direction of the lines of magnetic
flux (from the north pole to the south pole), and the thumb points in the direction
the wire is moving through the field, the second finger will point in the direction
of current flow (from positive to negative). This is also known as Fleming’s rule
for electric generators.
right-hand rule for the direction of magnetic flux. Place the fingers of the right
hand around a current-carrying conductor in such a way that the thumb points in
the direction of conventional current flow (from positive to negative). The
fingers will encircle the wire in the same direction as the lines of flux. This rule
is also known as Fleming’s rule for the direction of magnetic flux.

tubing can be used to join components only where there is no relative movement.
If there is relative movement, flexible hose must be used.
rime ice. A type of ice which forms on an aircraft flying through visible moisture
(as in a cloud) when the air temperature is below freezing. Rime ice is made of
ice crystals and is rough and milky looking. Rime ice not only adds weight to the
aircraft, but since it is rough, it disturbs the airflow over the wing and tail
surfaces and destroys lift.
ring cowl (reciprocating engine cowling). A type of cowling used to cover an
aircraft radial engine. A ring cowl surrounds the cylinder heads and decreases
the aerodynamic drag caused by the cylinders and improves the flow of cooling

the system. If the ring gear is rigidly mounted, the sun gear is driven by the input
shaft.
ring grooves (reciprocating engine piston). The grooves around a piston into
which the piston rings are installed. See piston rings (reciprocating engine

component).
ringworms (fabric defect). A series of circular cracks in the dope film on a
fabric-covered aircraft. Ringworms appear when a blunt object presses against
the fabric that is covered with a dope film that has become brittle because its
plasticizers have dried out. Ringworms can be removed by rejuvenating the
dope. See rejuvenation.

Most aircraft rivets are made of aluminum alloy and are driven cold. The rivet is
slipped through holes in the material being fastened, and a heavy steel bucking
bar is held against the end of the shank. The head of the rivet is hammered with a
rivet gun (an air hammer). The bucked head, or shop head, that is formed when
the rivet is driven, is flat on top, and its sides are rounded.

rivet set with a series of sharp blows. A rivet set, with a recess the shape and size
of the head of the rivet being driven, is held in the rivet gun with a spring-type
retainer. The rivet set is pressed against the head of the rivet, and a heavy
polished-steel bucking bar is held against the end of the rivet shank. The blows
on the head of the rivet upset the shank and cause it to swell out and form the
bucked, or shop, head.
rivet pitch. The distance between the center of adjacent rivets in the same row in
a riveted aircraft structure. See illustration for rivet gage.
rivet set. A tool used to drive aircraft rivets. A rivet set is a piece of hardened

the blade in the hub.
root mean square (rms) (alternating current value). A value used to measure the
heating effect of sine-wave alternating current. The rms value is found by
dividing one alternation of the AC into an infinite number of instantaneous
values. Each instantaneous value is squared (multiplied by itself), and all of the
squares are averaged to find the average, or mean, square. The square root is
taken of this mean square.
The rms value of sine wave alternating current is 0.707 time the peak value of

Small holes are drilled in the outer tube, and the inner tube is welded to it around
the circumference of the holes. Rosette welds are used to prevent the inner tube
moving inside the outer tube. This type of weld gets its name from the fact that
the finished welds look like small roses.

turpentine from the sap of pine trees. Rosin is used in the manufacture of paints,
inks, adhesives, and as a flux for soldering.
rosin-core solder. A type of solder used for electrical and electronic work. Rosincore solder is made in the form of a hollow metal wire, filled with rosin. When
the solder melts, the rosin flows out to cover the metal and keep oxygen away
from the surface, preventing the formation of oxides. Solder using synthetic
rosin for the core is called resin-core solder.
rosin joint (bad solder connection). The common term for a bad connection
made when soldering electrical wires. Rosin core or resin core solder is used for
this type of work, and it is possible for the melted flux to hold the wires together

rotary radial engine. A form of reciprocating engine used in some early airplanes
because of its light weight. In a rotary radial engine, the crankshaft is attached to

the airframe and the crankcase, cylinders, and propeller rotate. Rotary radial
engines were popular up through World War I.
rotary switch. An electrical switch capable of selecting any of several circuits.
Contacts around the periphery of an insulating wafer connect to all of the circuits
to be selected. The common lead is connected to a wiper that makes connection
with the contacts, one at a time. This wiper is turned by a shaft through the

remain constant as the rate of flow changes. Rotometers can be used to measure
the flow rate of either gases or liquids.

Rotorcraft-load combinations are designated as Class A, Class B, Class C, and
Class D, as follows:
(1) Class A rotorcraft-load combination means one in which the external load
cannot move freely, cannot be jettisoned, and does not extend below the
landing gear.

(2) Class B rotorcraft-load combination means one in which the external load
is jettisonable and is lifted free of land or water during the rotorcraft
operation.
(3) Class C rotorcraft-load combination means one in which the external load
is jettisonable and remains in contact with land or water during the rotorcraft
operation.

trailing edge of the vertical fin of an airplane. The rudder is moved by footoperated pedals in the cockpit, and movement of the rudder rotates the airplane
about its vertical axis.
rudder pedals (flight controls). The controls that allow the pilot to yaw the
aircraft. In an airplane, the rudder pedals move the rudder and produce an
aerodynamic force that causes the airplane to rotate about its vertical axis. In a
helicopter, the rudder pedals, more accurately called the anti-torque pedals,
control the pitch of the tail rotor to increase or decrease its thrust to rotate the
helicopter about its vertical axis.

ruddervator (airplane controls). Control surfaces on an airplane that combine the
functions of the rudder and the elevators. Ruddervators are the movable surfaces
in a V-tail empennage. Moving together, they act as elevators, rotating the
airplane about its lateral axis. Moving differentially, they act as the rudder to
rotate the airplane about its vertical axis.

points on a runway. Runway gradient is depicted on government aerodrome
sketches when the total runway gradient exceeds 0.3%.
runway heading. The magnetic direction that corresponds with the runway
centerline extended, not the painted runway number. When cleared to “fly or
maintain runway heading,” pilots are expected to fly or maintain the heading that

correction shall not be applied; e.g., Runway 4, actual magnetic heading of the
runway centerline 044, fly 044.

runway hotspots. Locations on a particular airport that historically have
hazardous intersections. Hot spots alert pilots to a possible lack of visibility at
certain points or the fact that the tower may be unable to see particular

be increasingly vigilant when approaching and taxiing through them. Pilots are
typically notified of these areas by a Letter to Airmen or by accessing the FAA
Office of Runway Safety.

to enter, cross, or takeoff from a runway. The system is installed at select
airports in the U.S. to assist in preventing runway incursions.
runway temperature. Temperature of the air just above a runway, ideally at
engine and/or wing height. Runway temperature is useful for determining
density altitude when computing engine and aircraft performance.

configurations, consisting of either eight longitudinal stripes of uniform
dimensions disposed symmetrically about the runway centerline, or a number of
stripes related to the runway width. In some instances, the landing threshold may
be displaced.
runway transition. In conventional STARs/SIDs, the portion of a STAR/SID that
serves a particular runway or runways at an airport. In RNAV STARs/SIDs,
defines a path(s) from the common route to the final point(s) on a STAR; or, the
common route that serves a particular runway or runways at an airport for a SID.
runway use program. A noise abatement runway selection plan designed to
enhance noise abatement efforts with regard to airport communities for arriving
and departing aircraft. These plans are developed into runway use programs and
apply to all turbojet aircraft 12,500 pounds or heavier; turbojet aircraft less than
12,500 pounds are included only if the airport proprietor determines that the
aircraft creates a noise problem. Runway use programs are coordinated with
FAA offices, and safety criteria used in these programs are developed by the
Office of Flight Operations.
runway visibility (meteorology). The meteorological visibility along an
identified runway, determined from a specified point on the runway. Runway
visibility may be determined by a transmissometer or by an observer.
runway visibility value (RVV). The visibility determined for a particular runway

centerline of a runway can see the runway surface markings or the lights

delineating the runway or identifying its centerline.
rust. A red oxide that forms on ferrous metal (metal that contains iron). Rust has
no strength, it is porous, and it continues to eat the metal until it is completely
destroyed. Rust can be prevented by keeping all oxygen away from the metal, by
painting it, or by coating it with a film of oil or grease.
ruthenium. A hard, white, acid-resistant, metallic chemical element.
Ruthenium’s symbol is Ru, its atomic number is 44, and its atomic weight is
101.07. Ruthenium is used as an alloying agent for platinum and palladium and
is also used in the manufacture of electrical contacts.
RVR (Runway Visual Range). An instrumentally derived horizontal distance a
pilot should see down the runway from the approach end. RVR is based on
either the sighting of high-intensity runway lights or on the visual contrast of
other objects, whichever yields the greatest visual range.
RVV. See runway visibility value.

stiff blade, motor driven in a reciprocating (in-and-out) fashion.
sacrificial corrosion. A form of corrosion in which an active material is used as
the anode in the corrosion process to protect a less active material. The anode is
sacrificed to save the cathode.
Steel parts are often plated with cadmium to sacrificially protect them from
corrosion. If the coating of cadmium is scratched through to expose the steel, a
corrosion cell is formed between the cadmium and the steel. The cadmium,
being more anodic (more chemically active) than the steel, will be changed into
a salt and it, rather than the steel, will corrode.
saddle gusset. A piece of plywood glued to an aircraft structural member. The
saddle gusset has a cutout to hold a backing block or strip tightly against the skin
to allow a nailing strip to be used to apply pressure to a glued joint in the skin.

formulates standards for the automotive and aviation industries.
safety alert (air traffic control). An alert issued by ATC to aircraft under their
control if ATC is aware that the aircraft is at an altitude which, in the controller’s
judgment, places it in unsafe proximity to terrain, obstructions, or other aircraft.
The controller may discontinue the issuance of further alerts if the pilot advises
he is taking action to correct the situation or has the other aircraft in sight.

safety belt. A belt installed in an aircraft to hold the occupants tight in their seat.
Safety belts are also called seat belts or lap belts.
safety critical. 14 CFR §401.5: “Essential to safe performance or operation. A
safety critical system, subsystem, component, condition, event, operation,
process, or item is one whose proper recognition, control, performance, or
tolerance is essential to ensuring public safety. Something that is safety critical
item creates a safety hazard or provide protection from a safety hazard.”
safety factor (structural design). The ratio of the maximum load a structure is
designed to support, to the maximum load it will ever be required to support. If a
beam is expected to support a maximum load of 10,000 pounds and is designed
in such a way that it can support 20,000 pounds, it has a safety factor of two.
safety gap (magneto ignition system). A location inside a high-tension magneto
in which a portion of the metal housing is close enough to the high-voltage
terminal to prevent the secondary voltage building up high enough to damage the
coil insulation. The spark plug normally provides the gap for the spark to jump,
but if a lead is off a spark plug, the secondary voltage could build up high
enough to damage the coil insulation. Rather than the voltage building up this
high, it jumps the safety gap.
safety glass. A type of glass that does not leave jagged fragments when it breaks.
Safety glass may be made by laminating a layer of resilient transparent plastic
material between two sheets of glass. This type of safety glass will break, but all
of the pieces stick to and are held by the center plastic layer. Another form of
safety glass is tempered glass that breaks into small grains, rather than into sharp
pieces.
safety logic system (air traffic control). A software enhancement to airport
surface detection equipment (ASDE-3, ASDE-X, and ASDE-3X) that predicts
the path of aircraft landing and/or departing, and/or vehicular movements on
runways. Visual and aural alarms are activated when the safety logic projects a
potential collision. The Airport Movement Area Safety System (AMASS) is a
safety logic system enhancement to the ASDE-3. The safety logic system for
ASDE-X and ASDE-3X is an integral part of the software program.
safety logic system alerts (air traffic control). Alerts generated by the safety
logic system of airport surface detection equipment, categorized into five types:
Alert, false alert, nuisance alert, valid non-alert, and invalid non-alert. An “alert”

is an actual situation involving two real safety logic tracks (aircraft/aircraft,
aircraft/vehicle, or aircraft/other tangible object) that the system has predicted
will result in an imminent collision. A “false alert” is an alert generated by one
or more false surface-radar targets that are interpreted as real tracks by the
system. A “nuisance alert” is generated by a known situation or approved
operation that is not considered unsafe (e.g., LAHSO). A “valid non-alert”
occurs in a situation in which the system software correctly determines that an
alert is not required based on the design specifications and current safety logic
parameters. An “invalid non-alert” occurs when the system software does not
issue an alert when one is required.
safety valve (pressure system component). A pressure relief valve used on
containers holding a compressible fluid under pressure. If the pressure inside the
container becomes excessive, the safety valve will pop off its seat and relieve the
excess pressure.
safety wire. Soft wire used to secure fasteners (bolts, pins, and clips) so they will
not vibrate loose in operation. Safety wire (also called lockwire) is made of
galvanized low-carbon steel, annealed stainless steel, or brass.
safety wiring (maintenance procedure). A method of securing a threaded device
so it cannot accidentally turn. Bolts, screws, and turnbuckles are often safetied
by passing soft steel or brass wire through holes in them, twisting the wire, and
attaching it to the structure in such a way that it pulls in the direction to tighten
the fastener.

airplanes flying through stormy weather. Static electricity from the clouds

collects on the airplane structure and discharges from sharp points in the form of
visible light.

chloride is one of the components of the moist-paste electrolyte used in carbonzinc flashlight batteries.
salient pole (electrical machine). A field pole of an electrical generator or motor
that has its own pole shoe protruding radially inward from the field frame. A
field coil is wound around this pole shoe. Salient poles are often used instead of
distributed poles which do not have separate pole shoes.

salt. A product of a chemical reaction in which a metal displaces the hydrogen in
an acid. If sulfuric acid (H2SO4) reacts with sodium hydroxide (NaOH), sodium
sulfate (Na2SO4) and water (H2O) are produced. Sodium sulfate is a salt. The
food seasoning called “salt” is sodium chloride (NaCl).
samarium. A pale gray, rare-earth, metallic chemical element. Samarium’s
symbol is Sm, its atomic number is 62, and its atomic weight is 150.35.

sand. A sandbag is used to shape sheet metal parts by forming a depression in
the sand and hammering the metal into it with a soft-face mallet.

sand casting (metal forming). A method of casting metal parts in a mold made of
sand. A pattern that duplicates the part to be molded is made of wood and is
covered with a special casting sand that contains a resin to bind it together.
The mold is separated along a special parting line, and the pattern is removed.
The mold is put back together, and the cavity is poured full of molten metal.
When the metal cools, the sand is broken away from the molded part. Sand
casting is less expensive than permanent-mold casting.
sanding coat (finishing system). A coat of heavy-bodied surfacer material
sprayed over a surface to be painted. After the sanding coat has thoroughly
dried, it is sanded to give a smooth surface over which the subsequent coats of
finishing material are applied.
sandpaper. An abrasive paper made by bonding grains of sharp sand to the
surface of a piece of paper. Sandpaper is used for abrading (wearing away)
rough surfaces or unwanted material.

clock error data.
satin-weave fabric. Fabric in which the warp threads pass under one fill thread
and over several more. Satin-weave fabrics are used when the lay-up must be

made over complex shapes.

saturated reactor (electrical component). A type of electrical transformer whose
core permeability is varied to control the current flowing in its secondary
winding. A control winding carrying direct current is wound over the
transformer core. When no current flows through the control winding, the
permeability of the core is high, and the transformer has enough inductive
reactance to decrease the secondary current.
When maximum current flows in the control winding, its magnetic field
saturates the core with a steady magnetic flux. This flux decreases the
permeability of the core so much that the changing flux caused by the secondary
current does not affect the core. There is less inductive reactance, so the
secondary current has less opposition, and it increases.
saturate (meteorology). To combine to such an extent that there is no more
tendency to combine. Dry air absorbs water vapor. But when the air becomes
saturated, it will not absorb any more. The amount of water the air can hold
before becoming saturated depends upon its temperature.
saturated adiabatic lapse rate (meteorology). The rate of decrease of temperature
with altitude as saturated air is lifted with no gain or loss of heat from outside
sources. The saturated adiabatic lapse rate varies with temperature, being
greatest at low temperature.
saturated air (meteorology). Air that cannot hold any more water vapor and has a
relative humidity of 100 percent.

saturated vapor. The condition of the vapor above a liquid that will not allow any
more of the liquid to evaporate.
saturated vapor pressure. The static pressure of a vapor when the vapor phase of
some material is in equilibrium with the liquid phase of that same material.
saturation (meteorology). The condition of the atmosphere when the actual water
vapor present in the air is the maximum the air can hold at the existing
temperature.
saturation current (electron control current). The plate current flowing in an
electron tube circuit when all of the electrons emitted from the cathode are
attracted to the plate. In a transistor circuit, saturation current is the current
flowing between the emitter and collector when an increase in the forward bias
between the base and emitter causes no further increase in the emitter-collector
current.
sawtooth waveform. The waveform of voltage produced by a relaxation
oscillator. The voltage across the capacitor in a relaxation oscillator rises
relatively slowly because it flows through the series resistor. But, when the
voltage rises to the ionization potential of the gas discharge tube, the tube fires
and the voltage across the capacitor drops off immediately. The slow rise and
rapid fall produce a sawtooth-shaped voltage wave. See relaxation oscillator.

“Say again” (air traffic control). A phrase used by ATC to request a repeat of the
last transmission. This usually specifies the transmission or the portion that was
not understood or received, such as “Say again all after Abram VOR.”
“Say altitude” (air traffic control). A phrase used by ATC to ascertain an
aircraft’s specific altitude or flight level. When the aircraft is climbing or
descending, the pilot should state the indicated altitude rounded off to the nearest
100 feet.
Saybolt universal viscosity. A measure of the viscosity (resistance to flow) of a
lubricating oil. The number of seconds needed for 60 milliliters of the liquid, at a

specified temperature, to flow through a calibrated orifice is measured and is
called the Saybolt Seconds Universal (SSU) viscosity of the liquid.
The viscosity number used for commercial aviation engine lubricating oil
relates closely to the SSU of the oil at 210°F. Aviation 80 engine oil has an SSU
viscosity at 210°F of 79.2, and Aviation 100 oil has an SSU viscosity of 103.0 at
the same temperature.
“Say heading” (air traffic control). A phrase used by ATC to request an aircraft
heading. The pilot should state the actual heading of the aircraft.

a wind tunnel model with Reynolds Number. It is extremely important in
correlating wind tunnel test data of scale models with the actual flight
characteristics of the full size aircraft. See Reynolds Number.
scale model. A copy of something made in the same proportions as the original,
but of a smaller size. When an airplane is designed, a scale model is built and
tested in a wind tunnel. The model has the same shape as the actual aircraft, but
it is much smaller. It is a scaled-down copy of the real thing.
scalene triangle. A closed, three-sided, plane (flat) figure that has no two sides of
the same length, nor are any of the angles the same.
scaling from a print. The measuring of a distance on a blueprint by using a ruler
or scale. This is not an acceptable practice, as the paper shrinks or stretches. All
dimensions and tolerances must be clearly indicated on the drawing so that there
is no need for scaling.
scan (instrument flying). The first fundamental skill of instrument flight, also
known as “cross-check”; the continuous and logical observation of instruments
for attitude and performance information.
scandium. A silvery-white, very lightweight, rare-earth, metallic chemical
element. Scandium’s symbol is Sc, its atomic number is 21, and its atomic
weight is 44.956. A radioactive isotope of scandium is used in petroleum
exploration.

scarfed patch. A type of patch made to a thin plywood structure. The damaged
area is cleaned out and the edges of the hole tapered, with the length of the taper
about 12 times the thickness of the plywood. Temporary backing blocks support
the area while the patch is glued in place. A scarfed patch is the most difficult to
make, but it is the preferred patch for aircraft plywood skins.
scarf joint (woodworking). A joint in a wood structure in which the ends to be
joined are cut in a long taper, normally 12:1, and fastened together by gluing. A
glued scarf joint makes a strong splice, because the joint is made along the side
of the wood fibers rather than along their ends.
scavenge. A term that means to collect and remove something that has been
used. In a turbine engine lubrication system, the scavenge subsystem collects the
oil after it has lubricated the bearings and gears and returns it to the oil tank.
scavenge oil system. The subsystem in the lubrication system of a gas turbine
engine that collects the oil after it has lubricated the bearings and gears and
returns it to the oil tank.
scavenger pump (lubrication system). A pump in a dry sump lubrication system
that picks up the oil after it passes through the engine and returns it to the oil
tank. Scavenger pumps have a larger capacity than pressure pumps, because the
oil being returned is hot and contains air. Both conditions increase its volume.
scenario-based training (SBT). A training method that uses a highly structured
script of real-world experiences to address aviation training objectives in an
operational environment.
scheduled maintenance. The individual maintenance tasks that are performed
according to the maintenance time limitations (maintenance schedule).

system. A Schrader valve is much like the valve used to put air into a tire.
scientific notation (mathematics). A mathematical time saver used when working
with very large and very small numbers. When using scientific notation, all
numbers are changed into a positive number between one and 10 by moving the
decimal point and attaching the number ten, raised to the power showing the
number of places the decimal has been moved.
A negative (minus) number is used if the decimal was moved to the right, and a
positive number is used if it is moved to the left. Using this system, 1,000 = 1 ·
103, and 0.001 = 1 · 10–3.
scimitar shape. The shape of the blades of the propellers mounted on an
unducted-fan engine. The name is taken from the shape of a curved Asian sword
that has its edge on the convex side.
scissors (landing gear component). A name commonly used for landing gear
torque links. See torque links.
score (mark). A scratch across a piece of material made to cause the material to
break along the line. When a piece of glass is to be cut with a glass cutter, it is
scored by scratching through its surface with the cutter. When the glass is bent,
all of the stresses concentrate in the scored line, and the glass breaks along the
line.
SCR (silicon controlled rectifier). A reverse-blocking triode thyristor that can be
triggered into conduction in only one direction. The three terminals of an SCR
are the anode, the cathode, and the gate.
An SCR blocks electron flow in both directions until a pulse of electrical
energy of the proper polarity is applied to the gate. The SCR will then conduct
electrons in its forward direction, between its cathode and its anode. A
conducting SCR will continue to conduct until the voltage across the anode and
cathode is removed or until its polarity is reversed. See thyristor.

from the cylinder wall and pumps it into the space between the piston and the
cylinder.

screeching (gas turbine engine operation). A condition of combustion instability
in a gas turbine engine or afterburner. The combustion produces a shrill, highpitched noise.
screech liner (turbine engine afterburner component). Screeching is a shrill, high
pitched noise caused by combustion instability as the tremendous amount of heat
is released in an afterburner. A screech liner that fits into the inner wall of an
afterburner duct is corrugated and perforated with thousands of small holes. It
minimizes the screeching by absorbing, or damping, some of the pressure
fluctuations.

screeding tool. A tool used when working with plastic resins, to spread the resin
evenly over a surface and level it. Screeding tools are often made of some form
of polyvinylchloride plastic material that releases the resin, making the tool easy
to clean.
screen grid (electron tube component). The grid in an electron tube between the
control grid and the plate (anode). The screen grid has a positive voltage on it
slightly lower than the voltage on the plate. The steady positive voltage on the
screen grid minimizes voltage feedback from the plate to the control grid
through the interelectrode capacitance.
screwdriver. A hand tool used to install or remove screws. The bit of a
screwdriver may be in the form of a straight, flat-edged blade, or it may be fluted
to fit into a recessed-head screw. A screwdriver has a handle on its shank in line
with the blade, but on the opposite end. The bit of the screwdriver fits into the
slot or recess in the head of the screw, and the handle is twisted to turn the
screw.
screw-pitch gage. A set of thin metal blades with a series of V-shaped notches
cut along one edge of each blade. The notched edge of each gage is compared
with the thread being checked until one is found that exactly meshes with it. The
number marked on the gage that fits the threads shows the number of threads per
inch in the nut or on the bolt.
scriber. A sharp-pointed tool used to scribe (mark) lines on metal.
scud (meteorology). A commonly used term for small patches of low clouds that
often form below a heavy overcast.
scuffing. A severe type of damage to moving parts caused when one metal part
moves across another without sufficient lubricant between them. Enough heat is
generated by friction to cause the high points of the surfaces to weld together,
and continued movement tears, or scuffs, the metal.
scupper (fuel tank component). A recess around the filler neck of an aircraft fuel
tank. Any fuel spilled when the tank is being filled collects in the scupper and
drains to the ground through a drain line, rather than flowing into the aircraft
structure.
SDF. See simplified directional facility.
sea anchor. An open-bottom canvas bucket towed behind a boat or seaplane in

the water. A sea anchor causes a large amount of drag and is used to reduce the
drift and to aid in maneuvering the vessel.
sea breeze (meteorology). A coastal breeze blowing from sea to land. Sea
breezes are caused by the temperature difference when the land surface is
warmer than the sea surface.
sea breeze front (meteorology). The leading edge of the intrusion of cooler, more
moist marine air associated with a sea breeze.
sea fog (meteorology). A type of advection fog that forms when air that has been
lying over a warm land surface moves over a colder water surface.
seal. A component used to prevent fluid leaking between two surfaces. If there is
relative movement between the surfaces, the seal is called a packing. If there is
no movement between the surfaces, it is called a gasket.
sea lane. A designated portion of water outlined by visual surface markers for
and intended to be used by aircraft designed to operate on water.
sealant. A heavy liquid or paste spread between two surfaces to form a seal.
Sealant may be used with a gasket or, in some instances, instead of a gasket.

position between the level of the water at low tide and the level at high tide.
sea-level-boosted engine. A reciprocating engine that has had its sea-level rated
horsepower increased by supercharging. This is the same as a ground-boosted
engine.
sea-level engine. 14 CFR Part 1: “A reciprocating aircraft engine having a rated
takeoff power that is producible only at sea level.”
sea-level pressure (meteorology). The atmospheric pressure that exists at mean
(average) sea level. Sea-level pressure can be measured directly, by stations
located at sea level, or determined from charts showing the station pressure and
temperature taken at stations not at sea level. Sea-level pressure is used as a
common reference for analysis of surface pressure patterns.
seam welding (electrical resistance welding). A form of electrical resistance
welding in which small metal wheels are used as the electrodes. These wheels
roll over the metal, and the current is conducted through the metal from the
wheel on one side to the wheel on the other side. Heat caused by the current

flowing through the resistance of the metal softens the metal, and pressure
between the wheels forces the softened metal in the two pieces to flow together.
Seam welding is similar to spot welding, except that the weld is a continuous
line, rather than individual spots. Fuel tanks are usually seam welded, rather than
spot welded.

seaplane. An airplane that can operate from water, rather than land. Some
seaplanes are landplanes with the wheels removed and floats installed. A flying
boat is a type of seaplane whose fuselage is similar to the hull of a boat.
Sponsons (a type of stub wing near the water line) or wingtip floats keep the
flying boat relatively level while it is in the water.
search and rescue (SAR). A service that seeks missing aircraft and assists those
found to be in need of assistance. It is a cooperative effort using the facilities and
services of available Federal, state and local agencies. The U.S. Coast Guard is
responsible for coordination of search and rescue for the Maritime Region, and
the U.S. Air Force is responsible for search and rescue for the Inland Region.
Information pertinent to search and rescue should be passed through any air
traffic facility or be transmitted directly to the Rescue Coordination Center by
telephone.
search and rescue facility. A facility responsible for maintaining and operating a
search and rescue (SAR) service to render aid to persons and property in distress.
It is any SAR unit or other operational activity which can be usefully employed
during an SAR Mission; e.g., a Civil Air Patrol Wing, or a Coast Guard Station.

ratio of the length of the hypotenuse to the length of the side adjacent to an acute
angle.
second (unit of angular measurement). One-sixtieth part of a minute of angular
measurement. Three hundred and sixty degrees, 21,600 minutes, or 1,296,000
seconds makes up a complete circle.
second (unit of time). The basic unit of time in both the English and the metric
systems of measurement. Sixty seconds is equal to one minute, 60 minutes
(3,600 seconds) is one hour, and 24 hours (86,400 seconds) is one day, or the
amount of time needed for one complete revolution of the earth.
secondary. A condition in which something has a level of importance just below
that which is most important.
secondary air (gas turbine engines). Air which has passed through a gas turbine
engine compressor and is used for cooling. Secondary air is not used in the
combustion process.
secondary cell (batteries). A battery which can be recharged after it has been
discharged. The action in which chemical energy is changed into electrical
energy is reversible. This means that electrical energy from a battery charger can
be changed into chemical energy to recharge the cell.
secondary color. A color produced by combining two primary colors in equal
proportions. Green is a secondary color made by mixing equal amounts of two
primary colors, yellow and blue.
secondary controls of an airplane. Controls that modify the effect of the ailerons,
rudder, and elevators of an airplane, and do not in themselves cause rotation of
the airplane about any of its three axes. Wing flaps, trim tabs, servo tabs, spring
tabs, and antiservo tabs are examples of secondary controls.
secondary current (electrical current). Current that flows in the secondary
winding of a transformer. Secondary current in a magneto ignition system is the
high-voltage current induced in the secondary winding of the magneto coil. It is

this secondary current that flows through the distributor and produces the spark
at the spark plug.
secondary emission (electron tubes). Emission of electrons in an electron tube
from an electrode other than the cathode. Secondary emission takes place when
electrons traveling at a high velocity strike the anode (plate) and knock other
electrons from it. When secondary emission is a problem, a suppressor grid is
installed near the anode. A negative voltage on the suppressor grid suppresses
the secondary emission by forcing the electrons that have been knocked from the
anode, back onto it.
secondary fuel (gas turbine engine fuel metering). The main flow of fuel from
the fuel nozzles inside a gas turbine engine. Primary, or pilot, fuel is used for
starting the engine and for low-speed operation. Secondary fuel allows the
engine to produce its maximum power.
secondary radar. Radar which responds to pulses of energy transmitted from an
interrogator. The response is transmitted on a frequency different from that
which was received.
secondary radar target. A target derived from a transponder return presented on a
radar display.
secondary standard. A unit of length, weight, voltage, capacitance, time, or other
value that is compared with a primary standard to determine its accuracy.
Secondary standards are working standards. A clock, for example, is used as a
secondary standard for measuring time, and it is calibrated by comparing it to the
time signal transmitted by radio station WWV. In this example, the signal
transmitted by station WWV is used as the primary standard.
secondary surveillance radar (SSR). A radar system that requires complementary
aircraft equipment (transponder). See air traffic control radar beacon system
(ATCRBS).
secondary voltage. The voltage in an alternating current circuit produced across
the secondary winding of a transformer.
secondary winding (electrical transformer). The transformer winding connected
to the electrical load. The winding connected to the source of electrical energy is
called the primary winding. If the secondary winding has more turns than the
primary winding, the transformer is a step-up transformer.

secondary winding (magneto coil). The winding in a magneto or ignition coil
that connects to the distributor rotor. The secondary winding is normally made
of very small-diameter wire and has a large number of turns, typically about
20,000.
second-class lever. A lever in which the fulcrum is at one end, and the lifting
force is at the other. The weight force is between the lifting force and the
fulcrum. A wheelbarrow is an example of a second-class lever.

second in command. 14 CFR Part 1: “A pilot who is designated to be second in
command of an aircraft during flight time.”
sectional chart. An aeronautical chart drawn to a scale of 1:500,000 (one inch is
equal to eight statute miles). Sectional charts are designed for visual navigation
of slow- or medium-speed aircraft. Topographic information on these charts
feature the portrayal of relief and a judicious selection of visual checkpoints for
VFR flight. Aeronautical information includes visual and radio aids to
navigation, airports, controlled airspace, restricted areas, obstructions, and
related data.
sectional view (aircraft drawing). A detail view in an aircraft drawing that shows
the inside of a part. A view of the main drawing is cut with a cutting plane, and

the sectional view is drawn to show the shape and construction of the piece
along this cutting plane.
sectioning (aircraft drawing). The use of cross-hatching to indicate the type of
material used in a sectional view of a part on an aircraft drawing.
sector (part of a circle). A part of a circle bounded by two radii and the arc that
lies between them.

sector gear. A piece of a gear wheel that contains the hub and a portion of the
rim with the teeth. A sector gear, which is used where only a small amount of
angular movement is needed, usually meshes with and drives a small pinion
gear. The shaft of the pinion gear can turn several revolutions, while the shaft of
the sector gear is turning through only a few degrees.
sector list drop interval (air traffic control). A parameter, in number of minutes
after the meter fix time, indicating when arrival aircraft will be deleted from the
arrival sector list. See also metering and meter time fix.
sector visibility (meteorology). Meteorological visibility within a specified
sector of the horizon circle.
security notice (SECNOT) (air traffic control). A request originated by the Air
Traffic Security Coordinator (ATSC) for an extensive communications search
for aircraft involved, or suspected of being involved, in a security violation. A
SECNOT will include the aircraft identification, search area, and expiration
time. The search area, as defined by the ATSC, could be a single airport,
multiple airports, a radius of an airport or fix, or a route of flight. Once the
expiration time has been reached, the SECNOT is considered to be cancelled.
security services airspace (air traffic control). Areas established through the
regulatory process or by NOTAM, issued by the FAA Administrator under 14

CFR §§99.7, 91.141, and 91.139, which specify that ATC security services are
required (i.e., ADIZ or temporary flight rules areas).
sediment. Contaminants that settle to the bottom of a reservoir or container.
see and avoid. When weather conditions permit, pilots operating IFR or VFR are
required to observe and maneuver to avoid other aircraft.
seesaw rotor (helicopter rotor). Another name for a semirigid rotor. A semirigid
rotor is a helicopter rotor whose blades can rotate about their feathering axis, but
there are no separate flapping hinges. The rotor pivots on the mast in much the
same way a seesaw pivots on its fulcrum.
segment (part of a circle). The part of a circle formed by a chord (a line passing
across the circle and touching the circumference at two points) and the arc
between the two points.

segmented circle. A visual indicator around a windsock or tetrahedron designed
to show the traffic pattern for each runway. Segmented circles are used at
airports without operating control towers, and which have some runways with
right-hand traffic patterns and others with left-hand patterns.

segmented-rotor brake (multiple-disk brake). A heavy-duty, multiple-disk brake
used on large, high-speed aircraft. Stators, surfaced with a material that retains

its friction characteristics at high temperatures, are keyed to the axle. Rotors,
keyed into the wheels, rotate between each pair of stators. The rotor disks are
made in segments to aid in dissipation of heat and to prevent their warping.
segments, of an instrument approach procedure. An instrument approach
procedure may have as many as four separate segments depending on how the
approach procedure is structured: (1) The initial approach segment between the
initial approach fix and the intermediate fix or the point where the aircraft is
established on the intermediate course or final approach course; (2) the
intermediate approach segment between the intermediate fix or point and the
final approach fix; (3) the final approach segment between the final approach fix
or point and the runway, airport, or missed approach point; and (4) the missed
approach segment between the missed approach point or the point of arrival at
decision height and the missed approach fix at the prescribed altitude.
seize (equipment failure). A type of failure in which parts stick or jam because
of friction, pressure, or excessive temperature.
Selcal system. Selective calling system. Each aircraft operated by an airline is
assigned a particular four tone audio combination for identification purposes. A
ground station keys the signal whenever contact with that particular aircraft is
desired. The signal is decoded by the airborne selcal decoder and the crew
alerted by the selcal warning system.
selection-type test items. Test items that require the student to choose from two
or more alternatives provided. True/false, matching, and multiple-choice type
questions are examples of selection-type test items.
selective availability (SA). A method by which the Department of Defense
(DOD) can, in the interest of national security, create a significant clock and
ephemeris error in the satellites, resulting in a navigation error.
selective plating. A method of electroplating only a portion of a metal part. The
portion not to be plated is masked with a nonconductive material, and only the
unmasked area accepts the electroplating.
selectivity (radio reception characteristic). The ability of a radio receiver to
separate the signals it receives. Selectivity is a very important characteristic of a
communications receiver because of the large number of transmissions in a
narrow band of frequencies. The better the selectivity of a receiver, the narrower
the band of frequencies it amplifies.

selector switch. A multi-pole switch used to connect a single conductor to any
one of several other conductors. See rotary switch.
selector valve (fluid power system component). A flow control valve used in
hydraulic systems to direct pressurized fluid into one side of an actuator, and at
the same time direct return fluid from the other side of the actuator back to the
reservoir. There are two basic types of selector valves: open-center valves and
closed-center valves. The four-port closed-center valve is the most frequently
used type. See closed-center selector valve and open-center selector valve.
selenium. A steel-gray, highly toxic, nonmetallic chemical element. Selenium’s
symbol is Se, its atomic number is 34, and its atomic weight is 78.96. Selenium,
which is in the sulfur family, has the useful characteristic of changing its
resistance as light falls on it. In the dark, selenium’s resistance is high, but in the
bright light, its resistance is low.
selenium rectifier. A type of rectifier using a cadmium and selenium junction to
control the flow of electrons. When a layer of selenium is deposited on an
aluminum base, and a cadmium alloy plate is pressed against the selenium, a
barrier is formed between the selenium and the cadmium. Electrons can easily
pass through this barrier from the cadmium, through the selenium to the
aluminum, but they cannot pass through the barrier in the opposite direction.
self-accelerating speed (turbine engine condition). The speed attained by a gas
turbine engine during start-up that allows it to accelerate to its normal idling
speed without assistance from the starter.
self-aligning bearing. A type of bearing used on a control rod end that functions
properly, even though the control rod does not move at right angles to the
surface to which it is attached. One of the most commonly used self-aligning
bearings is the spherical bearing. The bearing surface has the shape of a sphere
with a hole drilled through it. The two sides of the sphere perpendicular to the
hole are ground flat so it can be attached to the component to be moved by the
control rod. The control rod end has a socket into which the sphere fits, and the
sphere rotates on a film of grease. The rod end can be out of alignment by a few
degrees without affecting the operation of the bearing. Self-aligning bearings are
used in control rods installed in helicopter rotor systems.
self-centering chuck (machine tool component). A type of chuck used on a drill
motor or lathe that has all its jaws connected in such a way that they move

together. When a drill or piece of work is placed in the chuck and the jaws
tightened, all of the jaws move inward together and hold the drill or the work
centered in the chuck.
self-concept (in learning process). A factor that affects a person’s ability to
perceive and be receptive to experience. One’s self-image, whether it is positive
or negative, has great influence on the process of perception; if the image of self
is favorable, a person tends to be receptive to experiences and learn new things
easily. But a negative concept of self can inhibit the perceptual process and
cause a tendency to reject additional experience and learning.
self-demagnetization. The process in which the magnetic fields surrounding a
piece of magnetized material try to demagnetize it. If a permanent magnet sits
for a long period of time, it will partially self-demagnetize. But if a keeper, a
piece of soft iron, is placed across its poles, the lines of magnetic flux will not
spread out from the poles, and the magnet will self-demagnetize far less than if
no keeper were used.
self-excited generator. An electrical generator whose field coils are supplied
with current produced in the armature. The voltage regulator for a self-excited
generator is a variable resistor in the field circuit between the armature and the
field coils or between the field coils and ground. When the resistance in the field
circuit decreases, the field current increases, and the generator output voltage
increases. Most aircraft generators are self-excited, but DC alternators are not.

self-extinguishing. A combustible material is said to be self-extinguishing if it
burns when it is exposed to a flame or to a high temperature, but the burning
process automatically stops as soon as the flame or source of high temperature is
removed.

self-healing capacitor. An electrolytic capacitor with the ability to automatically
restore the oxide film dielectric to the plate if the film is ever punctured by too
high a voltage.
self-induction. The characteristic of an electrical conductor that causes a counter
electromotive force (CEMF, or back voltage) to be built up in it by alternating
current flowing through it. The expanding and collapsing magnetic field caused
by the alternating current cuts across the conductor and induces the CEMF in it.
The polarity of the self-induced voltage is always opposite that of the voltage in
the original circuit.

self-launch glider. A glider equipped with an engine so it can be launched under
its own power. When the engine is shut down, a self-launch glider displays the
same characteristics as a nonpowered glider.
self-locking nut. A type of nut with a built-in locking device that makes the nut
tightly grip the threads of the bolt. This locking device may be a fiber collar,
with a hole slightly smaller than the major diameter of the bolt threads, or it may
be a portion of the threads in the nut that is slightly out of phase with its main
threads. A self-locking nut must be turned onto a bolt with a wrench and grip the
bolt threads tightly enough that vibration will not cause it to loosen or back off.
self-tapping screw. A type of screw with sharp threads that cut their own
matching threads when screwed into soft metal, wood, or plastic. Self-tapping
screws are especially suited for holding together sheets of thin metal, and for this
reason, they are often called sheet-metal screws, or PK screws, after ParkerKalon, one of their major manufacturers.

Selsyn system. The registered trade name for a DC synchro system. Mechanical
movement of the transmitter shaft moves a two-arm wiper across a tapped,
circular, variable resistor. Direct current enters the transmitter through the arms
of the wiper and flows through the resistor out to the indicator. Here, the current
flows into three sections of a coil wound around a ring-shaped core. A small
permanent magnet on the pointer shaft is free to rotate inside the indicator coil.
As the wipers move across the transmitter resistor, the current in the three
sections of the indicator coil change. The changing current changes the magnetic
field produced by the coil so the magnet to which the pointer is attached moves
in exactly the same way as the shaft in the transmitter.
selvage edge (fabric). The woven edge of fabric used to prevent the material
unraveling during normal handling. The selvage edge, which runs the length of
the fabric parallel to the warp threads, is normally removed from materials
before they are used in composite construction.
semi. A prefix meaning partially or part (usually half) of something. A
semicircle is half of a circle, and a semiannual event is something that takes
place every half year (twice in a year).
semiautomatic operation. An operation that is partially automatic. Some manual
input is needed to start the operation, but once started, it completes its cycle of
operation with no further input.
semiconductor. A material whose electrical conductivity is between that of an
insulator and a conductor. The electrical properties of a semiconductor are
caused by its atomic structure and by the way the material has been processed.
Valence electrons are the electrons in the outer shell of an atom, and the
number of valence electrons is the important characteristic of the atomic

structure of a semiconductor material. Silicon and germanium, the two chemical
elements most often used for semiconductor devices, both have four valence
electrons.
An important step in the production of semiconductor materials is that of
“doping,” which is the addition of minute amounts of other chemical elements,
called impurity elements, which have either three or five valence electrons. Just
a few parts per million of these impurity elements cause the semiconductor
material to act as either a conductor or an insulator, depending upon the polarity
of the voltage placed across it.
semiconductor diode. A two-element, solid-state electron check valve made of
silicon or germanium, doped with appropriate impurities. Electrons can either
flow through a semiconductor diode or not flow through it depending upon the
polarity of the voltage across it.
When the diode is forward-biased, with the positive voltage connected to the
anode, and the negative voltage to the cathode, electrons flow through it. But,
when it is reverse-biased, with the negative voltage connected to the anode,
electrons do not flow through it.

semiconductor integrated circuit. A complex electronic circuit made on a single
chip of semiconductor material. Passive components, such as resistors and
capacitors, and active components such as transistors are formed by several
layers of conducting and insulating materials. These components are connected
together to form such complete circuits as gates and amplifiers.
semiconductor memory (computer memory). A computer memory in which data
is stored in semiconductor devices, such as flip-flop circuits and capacitors. Flipflops are normally used for static storage and capacitors for dynamic storage.
Static storage is used for ROM (read-only memory), in which data is
programmed when the chip is manufactured. Data can be read from it, but no
new data can be written into it. ROM is nonvolatile, meaning that the data
remains in ROM even when all computer power is turned off.

Dynamic storage is used for RAM (random-access-memory). Data can be both
written into RAM and read from it, and this data can be changed as needed. The
data stored in a dynamic RAM (D-RAM) is volatile. This means that all data is
lost when computer power is shut off. The data in a D-RAM must be continually
refreshed (the charge renewed) as the charge (the data) leaks off.
semiconductor transducer. A piezoelectric crystal that converts input energy of
one form, such as pressure, into output energy of another, such as an electrical
signal.
semicircular canal. An inner ear organ that detects angular acceleration of the
body.
semimonocoque structure (aircraft structure). A form of stressed skin structure
used in the construction of aircraft. Most of the strength of a semimonocoque
structure is in the skin, but the skin is supported on a substructure of formers and
stringers that gives the skin its shape and increases its rigidity.
semirigid rotor (helicopter rotor). A type of helicopter rotor that allows the pitch
of the blades to be changed by rotating the blades about their feather axis (the
axis that extends along the length of the blade). The blades cannot flap up and
down individually, but the entire rotor can flap as a unit. It is free to teeter (rock
back and forth) about the mast.
sender (fuel quantity measuring system). The part of a fuel quantity measuring
system located at the tank to measure the level of the fuel in the tank. In most
simple systems, the sender is a variable resistor mounted outside the tank with a
wire arm protruding into the tank. A float mounted on the arm rides on the top of
the fuel, and the arm is connected to the wiper of the variable resistor. As the
level of fuel in the tank changes, the position of the arm on the variable resistor
changes. The fuel quantity gage on the instrument panel measures the current
flowing through the variable resistor and translates this current into the amount
of fuel in the tank.
sense antenna (automatic direction finder antenna). A type of nondirectional
radio antenna used with an automatic direction finder. The sense antenna picks
up signals with equal strength from all directions. An ADF system uses two
antennas—a loop antenna and a sense antenna. The loop antenna is highly
directional; the strength of the signal it picks up changes with the direction

between the antenna and the station. But the signal strength is the same if the
station is in front of the antenna or behind it.
The signals picked up by both the loop antenna and the sense antenna are fed
into the same equipment, and as the two signals mix, they form a pattern that
allows the ADF system to measure the exact direction between the loop antenna
and the station being received. Using the sense antenna eliminates the problem
of 180° ambiguity. It allows the system to distinguish whether the station is in
front of the antenna or behind it.
sensible heat. Heat energy added to a material that causes it to change its
temperature, but not its physical state. The other kind of heat is latent heat,
which causes a material to change its physical state but not its temperature.
When a pan of water is put on a hot stove, sensible heat enters it until the water
reaches a temperature of 100°C (under standard conditions). At this temperature,
the water begins to boil, or change its physical state from liquid to gas without
increasing its temperature. Heat added to the water after it begins to boil is called
latent heat.
sensitive altimeter. A form of multipointer pneumatic altimeter with an
adjustable barometric scale that allows the reference pressure to be set to any
desired level. Sensitive altimeters have a high degree of mechanical
amplification in their movement. The small amount of movement of the
expanding bellows inside the instrument is multiplied enough to rotate one of the
pointers completely around the dial for a pressure change equivalent to only one
thousand feet of altitude. This is approximately one inch of mercury.
sensitive relay (electrical component). An electromagnetically operated switch
whose operating coil requires very little current to close the switch contacts.
Sensitive relays are used in photoelectric and thermocouple circuits. The very
small current produced by a photocell or thermocouple operates the relay, and
the relay contacts control enough current to operate other equipment. Sensitive
relays are being replaced today with solid-state devices that do the same job, but
have no moving parts.
sensitivity (radio receiver specification). A measure of the signal strength needed
to produce distortion-free output. The output must not have any excessive noise
(unwanted electrical signal) in it, and the output must be electrically identical to
the input, except for its higher voltage. A radio receiver with a high sensitivity
can produce a usable output from a very weak, or faint, input signal.

sensitivity time control (radar technology). A radar circuit designed to correct for
range attenuation so the echo intensity on the scope is proportional to reflectivity
of the target regardless of range.
sensor (automated equipment). The component in a piece of automated
equipment affected by some physical condition. The sensor sends signals into
the equipment so it will operate in the correct manner. An automatic cowl flap
actuation system has a temperature sensor affected by the cylinder head
temperature. This sensor sends signals to the cowl flap motor. If the cylinder
head temperature is too low, the motor closes the cowl flaps, and if the
temperature is too high, the motor opens them. A photoelectric cell is a form of
sensor. It is affected by the amount of light or by the color of the light.
sensory register. The portion of the brain that receives input from the five senses.
The individual’s preconceived concept of what is important determines how the
register prioritizes the information for passing it on to the rest of the brain for
action.
separation (air traffic control). The spacing of aircraft to achieve their safe and
orderly movement in flight and while landing and taking off.
separation minima (air traffic control). The minimum longitudinal, lateral, or
vertical distances by which aircraft are spaced through the application of air
traffic control procedures.
sequence valve (fluid power system component). A type of flow control valve
that allows one system to fully operate before another system begins its
operation. Sequence valves are used in aircraft hydraulic systems to cause the
wheel well doors to open fully before the landing gear is released from its
uplocks.
sequencing mode. The FMS/RNAV mode that automatically sequences along
the waypoints in the programmed route. The sequencing mode alerts the pilot to
upcoming waypoints, and offers guidance to each successive waypoint in the
route.
sequential logic devices. Digital memory devices that have several inputs and
several outputs. The combination of bits at the outputs is determined by the bits
on the inputs and the bits that were previously on the inputs.
SER. See start end of runway.

serial number. An identification number assigned sequentially to items which
have the same part number.
serial operation (computer operation). Data transfer by moving bits sequentially,
one at a time, rather than simultaneously, as is done by parallel operation. Series
operation is much slower than parallel operation, but it requires far less complex
circuitry.
series circuit. A type of circuit in either an electrical or a fluid power system in
which all of the components are connected in such a way that they provide only
one path from the source of current or fluid flow, through all of the components,
and back to the source.

series-parallel circuit (electrical circuit). A type of electrical circuit in which
some of the components are connected in series, and others are connected in
parallel.

series resonant circuit. A resonant AC electrical circuit that contains a capacitor
and an inductor connected in series. At the resonant frequency of the circuit, the
inductive reactance and the capacitive reactance are the same. But they are 180°
out of phase, and they cancel each other. The only opposition to the flow of AC
in a series resonant circuit is caused by the circuit resistance.

series-wound generator (electrical generator). A form of electrical generator in
which the field coils are connected in series with the armature. Series-wound
generators are not commonly used to supply power for aircraft electrical systems
because of the difficulty in controlling the output voltage.

series-wound motor (electric motor). A commutator-type electric motor that has
the field coils connected in series with the armature. A series-wound motor has a
high starting torque, but if it is not operated with a mechanical load connected to
it, it will accelerate to a speed that will destroy it. Starter motors for both
reciprocating engines and gas turbine engines are series-wound.
serious injury. An injury that: (1) Requires hospitalization for more than 48
hours, commencing within 7 days from the date of the injury was received; (2)
results in a fracture of any bone (except simple fractures of fingers, toes, or

nose); (3) causes severe hemorrhages, nerve, muscle, or tendon damage; (4)
involves any internal organ; or (5) involves second- or third-degree burns, or any
burns affecting more than 5 percent of the body surface.
serrations. A series of teeth or notches, usually along the cutting edge of a knife
or a saw.
service (air traffic control). A generic term that designates functions or
assistance available from or rendered by air traffic control. For example, Class C
service would denote the ATC services provided within a Class C airspace area.
serviceable (physical condition). The condition of a piece of equipment that
allows it to be returned to service or to be installed in an operating aircraft.
serviceable limits. One type of limits included in a reciprocating engine overhaul
manual. If a part measures outside of the new-parts limits, but within the
serviceable limits, it will likely not wear to the point of causing engine failure
within the next TBO interval.
service bulletin (maintenance information). A bulletin issued by the
manufacturer of an aircraft, engine, or component that describes a service
procedure the manufacturer recommends to make the device safer or to improve
its service life.
service ceiling (aircraft performance). The highest altitude at which an aircraft
can maintain a steady rate of climb of 100 feet per minute.
service life. The length of time a piece of equipment can reasonably be expected
to operate in a satisfactory manner.
service manual (maintenance information). A manual written by the
manufacturer of an aircraft, engine, or component that describes the way the
device should be serviced and maintained. The service manual for an FAAcertificated aircraft is approved by the FAA, and it serves as approved data for
making repairs.
servo (automatic pilot component). A component in an automatic flight control
system that actually moves the flight control. There are servos in each of the
primary controls: the ailerons, elevators, and rudder. The automatic pilot senses
when a flight correction is needed, and it sends a signal to the servo to move the
control surface in the proper direction to make the correction.

servo altimeter. A type of pneumatic altimeter in which the bellows moves an
electrical pickup whose signal is amplified enough for it to drive a servo motor.
The servo motor moves the drums and pointer in the display.
servo amplifier. An electronic amplifier in an autopilot system that increases the
signal from the autopilot enough that it can operate the servos that move the
control surfaces.
servo brake. A type of wheel brake that uses the momentum of the aircraft to
increase the friction applied by the brake. The brake drum is a hollow cylinder,
turned by the wheel that rides over the brake shoes.
Brake linings, made of a material with a high coefficient of friction, are bonded
to the surface of steel brake shoes and are pressed against the inside of the drum
by the piston in a hydraulic brake cylinder. When the brakes are not being
applied, a spring holds the shoes away from the drum. When the pilot depresses
the brake pedal, hydraulic fluid forces the piston out and moves the shoe against
the drum. The shoe is mounted in such a way that when it contacts the rotating
drum, friction wedges it tightly against the drum. Movement of the aircraft
increases the friction produced by the brake.
servo feedback. A type of automatic control system in which part of the output is
fed back into the input to help control the action. In an automatic pilot system,
an attitude sensor detects a wing dropping and generates an error signal that
causes the servo to move the aileron down.
A servo feedback signal is sent from the aileron to the attitude sensor,
indicating that corrective action is being taken. The attitude sensor progressively
cancels its error signal as the deflected aileron brings the wings back to a level
attitude. By the time the wings are level, the error signal is eliminated and the
aileron is no longer deflected.
servo loop. See servo feedback.
servomechanism. A type of control system in which a small signal or small force
is used to control a much larger force. In a hydraulic servomechanism, a sensor
detects that some type of output movement is needed. A control valve directs
hydraulic fluid into a hydraulic actuator, and the movement takes place. A
feedback sensor compares the amount the actuator moves with the amount of
movement the original sensor called for, and when the actuator has moved the
correct amount, the selector valve is shut off.

servo tab (aircraft controls). A small movable tab built into the trailing edge of
an aircraft primary control surface. A servo tab is actuated by the cockpit
control, and it moves in the direction opposite to the direction the primary
surface is to move. The servo tab produces an aerodynamic force that moves the
surface on which it is mounted.

servo-type carburetor. A type of carburetor or continuous-flow fuel injection
system that uses the pressure drop across a servo bleed orifice (a metering jet) to
control the amount of metered fuel allowed to flow to the cylinders. The servo
system adjusts for changes in inlet fuel pressure so the pressure of the fuel sent
to the cylinders is proportional only to the amount of air being drawn into the
cylinders.
sesquiplane (type of airplane). A biplane in which one wing, usually the lower
wing, has an area less than one-half the area of the other wing.
setback (sheet metal layout). A measurement used in sheet metal layout. Setback
is the distance the jaws of a brake must be set back from the mold line to form a
bend. Setback for a 90° bend is equal to the inside radius of the bend, plus the
thickness of the metal being bent. For a bend of other than 90°, a factor called a
K-factor must be used. See K-factor.

setscrew. A headless screw used to prevent relative movement between a wheel
and a shaft. A hole is drilled through the hub boss of the wheel, and it is tapped
so a setscrew can be screwed through it and tightened against the shaft. The set
screw prevents the wheel turning on the shaft.
settling with power (helicopter operation). An operation of a helicopter in which
the main rotor is operating in its own downwash. The flow of air through the
center portion of the rotor disk is upward, and the flow through the outer portion
of the disk is downward, as it should be. Settling with power is more correctly
called “operating in the vortex ring.”
severe weather avoidance plan. See SWAP.
severe weather forecast alerts. Preliminary messages issued in order to alert
users that a severe weather watch bulletin (WW) is being circulated by the SPC
(Storm Prediction Center). See severe weather watch bulletin (WW).
severe weather watch bulletin (WW). An aviation weather report from the Storm
Prediction Center in Norman, OK, that identifies areas of possible severe
thunderstorms or tornado activity. WW messages are unscheduled and issued as
required. A preliminary message called a severe weather forecast alert (AWW)
is issued to alert airmen a bulletin is forthcoming.
sewed-in panel repair (aircraft fabric repair). A repair to a fabric-covered
airplane wing in which a section of fabric extending from the leading edge to the
trailing edge between two or more ribs is replaced by sewing the new fabric to
the old. All the seams are reinforced with surface tape.
sewed-patch repair (fabric covering repair). A repair to a damaged fabriccovered structure that cannot be repaired by closing with stitches. The damaged
area is removed and a piece of new fabric is used to replace the removed fabric.
It is sewed by hand with baseball stitches. After the patch is in place it is shrunk
with dope and the seams covered with surface tape.
sextant (navigation instrument). An optical instrument used in celestial
navigation to measure the angle between the horizon and a line to one of the
navigational stars. By finding this angle and referring to the appropriate tables in
a nautical almanac for the exact time the observation was made, the observer can
determine his latitude and longitude.

Seyboth fabric tester (aircraft fabric tester). A type of tester used to determine
the condition of the fabric installed on an aircraft. A specially shaped, springloaded, sharp-pointed plunger is pressed into the fabric until a shoulder around
the point contacts the fabric. The amount of force required to press the shoulder
to the fabric is measured on a colored scale in the handle of the tester. Weak
fabric requires very little force to press the shoulder against the fabric, and it
shows up as a red band. Airworthy fabric requires enough force to compress the
spring that the indicator moves up to one of the green bands.
A Seyboth test does not indicate the strength of the fabric in pounds per inch,
but it is sufficiently accurate to distinguish between fabric that is either definitely
good or definitely bad.
S-glass (composites). A glass that contains magnesia, alumina, and a silicate. It
is used as a fiber in fiberglass cloth where high strength is required.
shaded-pole motor (AC electric motor). A type of alternating current induction
motor used for light-duty, constant-speed loads, such as fans, blowers, and tape
players. A coil excited by single-phase alternating current is wound around a
laminated steel frame, and a squirrel-cage rotor is mounted in bearings attached
to the frame. Shading coils made of one or two bands of heavy copper are
installed around diagonally opposite pole shoes, the part of the frame around the
rotor.
Current induced into the shading coils by the AC in the exciter coil
demagnetizes the part of the pole shoe around which it is wound. The AC
alternately magnetizes and demagnetizes the corners of the pole shoes,
producing a rotating magnetic field which the squirrel-cage rotor follows.
Shaded-pole motors have a relatively constant speed, but their torque is quite
low.
shaft axis (helicopter design). The line consistent with the rotor shaft (mast).
Only when the plane of rotation is exactly perpendicular to the shaft axis will the
axis of rotation coincide with the shaft axis.
shaft horsepower. The horsepower actually available at a rotating shaft.
shaft runout (engine overhaul measurement). The amount the end of the
crankshaft of an aircraft reciprocating engine is bent. Shaft runout is measured
by mounting the shaft in a set of V-blocks and holding the arm of a dial indicator
against the edge of the shaft at its end. When the shaft is rotated, the pointer of
the dial indicator shows the amount the shaft is bent or out of round.

shaft turbine (gas turbine engine). A turboshaft engine that uses most of the
energy extracted from the burning fuel to drive an output shaft. Turboshaft
engines are used to power helicopter rotors.
shake (wood defect). Longitudinal cracks in a piece of wood, usually between
two annual rings.
shallow banked turn. A turn less than approximately 20 degrees; the aircraft’s
inherent lateral stability often acts to level the wings unless the pilot maintains
the bank.
shank of a drill. The smooth part of the body of a twist drill that fits into the drill
chuck. The three basic parts of a twist drill are the shank, the body (the flutes),
and the point.
shared-use airport. A U.S. government-owned airport that is co-located with an
airport specified under 14 CFR §139.1(a) and at which portions of the movement
areas and safety areas are shared by both entities.
shaving (metal-cutting operation). An operation in which thin layers of metal are
removed from the outer surface of the device being shaved.
shear. To cut by causing the parts to slide over each other.
shear failure (structural failure). The failure of a riveted or bolted joint in which
the fastener, rather than the material being joined, fails. The fasteners (rivets or
bolts) shear off, rather than the material tearing at the fastener hole. A joint
should be designed so it will fail in shear rather than in bearing. When a joint
fails in shear, only the fasteners must be replaced; but if it fails in bearing, the
torn material must be repaired.
shear nut. A thin nut used on a clevis bolt to hold the bolt in place. Shear nuts are
used when the fastener on which they are screwed is loaded in shear only. They
do not have enough threads to allow their use for a tensile load.
shear pin. A pin used to protect a piece of equipment by intentionally shearing if
the equipment should seize. A shear pin is used in the drive shaft of some
engine-driven pumps. If the pump should seize, the shear pin will break and
allow the shaft to turn, but the pump is protected from further damage.
shears (cutting tools). A type of cutting tool used to cut sheet metal, paper, or
cloth. Shears are similar to scissors, except that they are usually larger and more

powerful. Power shears, used to cut thick sheets of metal, are driven by an
electric motor.
shear section. A necked-down section of an engine-driven pump shaft designed
to shear if the pump should seize. When the shear section breaks, the drive can
continue to turn without causing further damage to the pump or the engine.
shear strength (sheet metal construction). The strength of a riveted joint in a
sheet metal structure in which the rivets shear before the metal tears at the rivet
holes. A properly designed riveted joint will fail in shear. The rivets will shear
before the metal tears at the rivet holes.
shear stress. A type of stress that tries to slide an object apart.
shear wave (mechanical vibration). A vibrational wave within an elastic material
in which the material changes its shape without changing its volume.
sheave. A grooved wheel used as a pulley. A sheave can be used to change the
direction a cable must be pulled to move a weight and it can also be used to
increase the force applied to a weight. If a sheave is attached to a weight, the
amount of force needed to lift the weight is only one half the weight. But the
cable will have to be pulled twice the distance the weight is lifted.
sheet metal. Metal that has been rolled into sheets whose thickness is less than
0.25 inch. Metal whose thickness is greater than 0.25 inch is called metal plate.
sheet metal layout. The drawing or pattern used to cut a piece of sheet metal.
The layout includes marks to locate all of the bend tangent lines and the center
marks for all of the holes to be drilled.
shelf cloud (meteorology). A low-level, horizontal, wedge-shaped arcus cloud
associated with a convective storm’s gust front (or occasionally with a cold
front).
shelf life. The normal length of time an object or material can be expected to
keep its usable characteristics if it is stored and not used. Many products, such as
batteries, rubber seals, shock cord, and certain types of finishing materials, have
a date stamped on them. This date relates to the shelf life. If these products are
not used by the date stamped on them, there is a possibility that they will not
function as they should.

shell (atomic structure). The outer structure of an atom formed by electrons
having the same energy level as they spin around the nucleus. The K shell is
nearest the nucleus. The L shell is next and, depending on the number of
electrons, an atom can also have M, N, O, P, and Q shells.
shell-type transformer. A type of electrical transformer encased in a steel shell.
The shell completely surrounds the winding and keeps magnetic lines of flux
from radiating out from the transformer.
SHF (Superhigh Frequency). Electromagnetic energy with a frequency between
3 and 30 gigahertz (3 · 109 and 30 · 109 hertz). The SHF band is used for
weather and doppler radar.
shielded-arc welding. A form of arc welding in which the arc and the metal
being welded are shielded, or covered, with an inert gas or with melted flux that
keeps air away from the molten metal in the weld.
shielded cable. An electrical cable of one or more insulated conductors enclosed
by a shield that may be composed of braided strands of copper (or other metal), a
nonbraided spiral winding of copper, or a layer of metal tape.
shielded conductor (electrical conductor). Insulated electrical wire enclosed in a
conducting braid, usually made of tinned copper. The braid is grounded so any
electromagnetic radiation picked up by the braid is carried to ground. This
prevents interference with the signal being carried in the conductor.

shielded ignition cable (reciprocating engine ignition system component). A type
of ignition cable used to carry high voltage from the magneto distributor to the
spark plug. Shielded ignition cable is used in aircraft installations where the
electromagnetic radiation from the high-voltage spark plug leads could cause
radio interference.

The spark plug leads are enclosed in a metal braid. One end of the braid is
connected to a terminal in a shielded spark plug, and the other end is connected
to the magneto distributor. Any radio-frequency energy that radiates from the
wire when the spark is jumping the gap in the spark plug is picked up by the
braid and carried to ground, rather than radiating into space and causing radio
interference.
shielded spark plug (reciprocating engine ignition system component). A spark
plug entirely enclosed in a steel housing. A shielded ignition lead terminates
with an insulated connector that fits into an insulated cavity inside the spark
plug. The nut on the end of the ignition lead screws onto the spark plug barrel.
Electromagnetic energy released when the spark jumps the gap in the spark plug
is picked up by the metal in the spark plug and the shielded ignition lead, and is
carried to ground preventing it from causing radio interference.
shielded wire. Electrical wire enclosed in a braided metal jacket.
Electromagnetic energy radiated from the wire is trapped by the braid and
carried to ground.
shielding. A metal braid that encloses wires which carry high-frequency
alternating current or high-voltage DC that has radio-frequency energy
superimposed on it. The shielding intercepts any electromagnetic radiation and
carries it to the engine structure so it will not interfere with any installed
electronic equipment.
shim. A thin piece of material used to fill a space between two objects or to level
an object. Thin metal shims are used in some bevel gear systems to adjust the
gear preload, and behind some bearing inserts to adjust the clearance between
the bearing and the shaft.
shimmy. Abnormal, and often violent, vibration of the nose wheel of an airplane.
Airplane nose wheel installations must be loose enough to allow them to be
steered, but if they are too loose, they will shimmy. Shimmying is prevented by
a shimmy damper. See shimmy damper.
shimmy damper (aircraft landing gear component). A small hydraulic shock
absorber installed between the nose wheel fork and the nose wheel cylinder
which is attached to the aircraft structure. The piston inside the shimmy damper
cylinder is free to move back and forth when it is moved slowly enough to allow
fluid to transfer from one side of the piston to the other through a restrictor. Slow

movement of the piston allows the nose wheel to pivot so the aircraft can be
steered on the ground. But, the restrictor slows the flow of fluid inside the
cylinder and prevents the piston from moving back and forth as fast as it would
if the nose wheel were shimmying.
shock absorber (aircraft landing gear component). A device in an aircraft landing
gear that absorbs the shock which occurs when an aircraft touches down on
landing. The most commonly used shock absorber is the oleo (oil and air) shock
strut. The initial landing impact is taken up by oil transferring from one chamber
inside the shock absorber to another through a metering orifice. The much
smaller shocks that occur when the aircraft is taxiing are taken up by a cushion
of compressed air.
shock cool. Rapid cooling of a piston engine by suddenly retarding the throttle
while the engine is hot and the outside air is cold. Shock cooling causes the
cylinders to shrink around the pistons and cause serious cylinder wall scuffing.
shock mount. A type of vibration isolator used between a moving vehicle and a
component sensitive to vibration. Shock mounts allow the component a certain
degree of free movement, but absorb the high-frequency vibrations that are so
destructive to delicate mechanisms.

shock stall (high-speed aerodynamics). A type of stall that affects some airplanes
as they fly in the transonic speed range. In the transonic range, some air flowing
over the aircraft surface is moving faster than the speed of sound, while other air
is moving at a speed slower than the speed of sound.

When a shock wave forms on the upper surface of a wing, it gets in the way of
the air flowing behind it, and this air breaks away from the wing surface. The
shock wave causes the wing to stall. Shock stalls can cause control problems as
an airplane is passing from subsonic flight into supersonic flight.
shock strut. See shock absorber.
shock wave. A pressure wave formed in the air as an object, such as a flight
vehicle, passes through the air at a speed greater than the speed at which sound
can travel. As the vehicle moves through the air, it creates disturbances, and
sound waves spread out in all directions from the disturbance. Since the vehicle
is flying faster than the sound waves are moving, they build up and form a shock
wave at the front and the rear of the vehicle. As air passes through a shock wave,
it slows down and its static pressure increases. The energy in the air is decreased.
See oblique shock wave and normal shock wave.

shop head (rivet head). The head of a solid rivet which is formed when the shank
is upset.

Shore Scleroscope. A form of hardness tester used to determine the hardness of
such material such as rubber, metal, or plastic. A metal weight is dropped
through a glass tube onto the surface of the material being tested, and the height
of the rebound of the weight is measured. The harder the material, the higher the
weight will bounce.
short circuit (electrical circuit). An electrical circuit in which there is a fault that
causes electrons to flow across a portion of the circuit that should act as an
insulator. The electrons find a short path to ground. Fuses and circuit breakers
protect the circuit from damage that could be caused by excess current flowing
through a short circuit.
short-field landing. Landing technique that becomes necessary when you have a
relatively short landing area or when an approach must be made over obstacles
that limit the available landing area.
shorting switch. A type of make-before-break switch. A make-before-break
switch is a multipole switch in which one circuit is completed before another
circuit is opened. A shorting switch is used in circuits that must never operate,
even for a microsecond, without an electrical load being connected.
short range clearance. A clearance issued to a departing IFR flight which
authorizes IFR flight to a specific fix short of the destination while air traffic
control facilities are coordinating and obtaining the complete clearance.
short stacks (reciprocating engine exhaust system). The exhaust system of an
aircraft reciprocating engine made of short pipes that direct the exhaust gases
from each individual cylinder of the engine away from the aircraft.
short takeoff and landing aircraft (STOL). An aircraft which, at some weight
within its approved operating weight, is capable of operating from a STOL
runway in compliance with the applicable STOL characteristics, airworthiness,
operations, noise, and pollution standards.
short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL). The ability of some aircraft to take
off from a short runway, and land vertically (i.e., with no runway).
short wave (radio waves). Waves of electromagnetic radiation that are shorter
than 60 meters, or about 197 feet. The frequencies used for short-wave radio
communications are above about five megahertz.
shot peening (metal treatment). A method of strengthening the surface of a metal

part by blasting it with steel shot. The blows from the steel shot produce a
compressive stress on the surface of the metal which must be overcome by a
tensile stress of a greater intensity before the tensile stress can cause the surface
of the metal to crack.
shoulder bolt. A special type of fastener used to prevent damage to a structure
that could be caused by squeezing the surfaces together when the nut is tightened
on the bolt. The diameter of the shank is larger than the diameter of the threaded
portion of the bolt. The length of a shoulder bolt is chosen so its shank is the
same length as the thickness of the material being fastened together.

shoulder-wing airplane. A monoplane in which the wing is mounted near the top
of the fuselage, but not on the top. The classifications of a monoplane with
regard to the placement of the wing are: low-wing, midwing, shoulder-wing,
high-wing, and parasol-wing.
show. A term meaning to demonstrate, confirm, validate, or substantiate
something. In legal documents it means to plead or allege. 14 CFR Part 1:
“Unless the context otherwise requires, means to show to the satisfaction of the
Administrator.”
shower (meteorology). Precipitation from a cumuliform cloud. Showers are
characterized by the suddenness of beginning and ending, by the rapid change of
intensity, and usually by the rapid change in the appearance of the sky. Showery
precipitation may be in the form of rain, ice pellets, or snow.
Shower of Sparks ignition system (aircraft reciprocating engine ignition system).
The registered trade name for a type of magneto ignition system. When the
ignition switch in a Shower of Sparks ignition system is placed in the START
position, the primary circuit of the right magneto is grounded, and pulsating
direct current from a vibrator flows into the primary winding of the left magneto
to ground through a set of retard breaker points. When the crankshaft turns far

enough for the retard points to open, the pulsating DC in the primary winding
induces a high voltage in the secondary winding of the left magneto. This high
voltage causes the spark plugs connected to the left magneto to produce a
“shower of sparks.”
show-type finish (aircraft finish). A type of finish put on some aircraft that are
built for show. A show-type finish is usually made up of many coats of dope or
lacquer, with much sanding and rubbing of the surface between coats.
shrink fit. An interference fit between pieces of an assembly. The hole into
which a part is to fit is enlarged by heating it, and the piece to fit into the hole is
shrunk by chilling it. The two pieces are assembled while their temperatures are
different. Then, when they reach the same temperature, the fit is so tight no
relative movement can take place between the parts.
shrinking blocks (sheet metalworking tool). A pair of wooden blocks used to
clamp a sheet of metal to keep it from buckling when it is hammered with a
mallet to shrink it.
shrink-wrapping. A method used to protect products from damage while they are
being displayed for sale. The material to be shrink-wrapped is covered with a
thin film of transparent thermoplastic material. Heat is applied, and the film
shrinks to form a smooth protective cover.
shroud (air-cooled engine component). A sheet-metal cover placed over an aircooled engine to pick up and force cooling air through the cylinder fins to
remove heat from the engine.
shrouded-tip turbine blades (gas turbine engine component). A type of turbine
blade with a T-shaped tip. The tips of the blades touch each other to form a ring
around the turbine wheel to support the blades.
shunt (electrical instrument component). A precision resistor installed in parallel
with a voltage measuring instrument to measure the amount of current flowing in
a circuit. Load current flows through the shunt and produces a voltage drop
proportional to the amount of current flowing through it.
A millivoltmeter whose dial is calibrated in amps is used to read the voltage
drop across the shunt. The standard shunt used with aircraft ammeters produces
a voltage drop of 50 millivolts when the shunt’s rated current flows through it.

shunt circuit (electrical circuit). A parallel circuit, or a circuit in which there are
more than one path for electrons to flow.
shunt ohmmeter. A type of ohmmeter used for measuring very low values of
resistance. Voltage across the meter is adjusted until the meter pointer deflects
full scale. Then, the unknown resistor is connected in parallel (in shunt) with the
meter. The resistance of the unknown resistor is indicated by the decrease in the
current flowing through the meter.
shunt winding. Field coils in an electric motor or generator that are connected in
parallel with the armature.
shunt-wound generator. An electrical generator whose field windings are
connected in shunt (parallel) with the armature winding. Most aircraft generators
are shunt-wound, because their output voltage can be controlled by varying the
amount of current flowing through the shunt-connected field winding.

shunt-wound motor. A commutator-type electric motor in which the field
windings are connected in shunt (parallel) with the armature. Shunt-wound
motors do not have a large amount of starting torque, but they operate at a
relatively constant speed, and they do not need to have a mechanical load
connected to them to prevent them from overspeeding. Shunt-wound motors are
used for blowers and other low-torque applications.
shut-off valve (fluid power system component). A valve used in a fluid power
system to shut off the flow of fluid.
shuttle valve (fluid power system component). A type of automatic selector
valve installed in a critical portion of a fluid power system. Fluid for normal
operation of the system flows through the shuttle valve into the actuating
cylinder. But if the normal system pressure fails, emergency fluid pressure can
be directed into the actuator through the shuttle valve. Shuttle valves are used in
aircraft landing gear and brake systems to allow compressed air to be used to
extend the landing gear or apply the brakes if the normal hydraulic system
should fail.
SI. The universal abbreviation for the International System of Units. See
International System of Units.
SID. See standard instrument departure.
SID (Standard Instrument Departure) charts. Aeronautical charts designed to
expedite clearance delivery and facilitate transition between takeoff and enroute
operations.
sidebands (radio transmission). The bands of frequencies on either side of the
carrier frequency in amplitude modulated (AM) radio transmission. The
bandwidth of a transmitted radio signal includes the carrier frequency (the
frequency produced by the oscillator in the transmitter) and the frequencies of
both the lower and the upper sidebands.
The frequency of the lower sideband is the carrier frequency minus the highest
audio frequency used to modulate the carrier. The frequency of the upper
sideband is the carrier frequency plus the highest audio frequency used to
modulate the carrier.

side slip (airplane flight maneuver). A flight maneuver in which the airplane is
banked while the rudder keeps it on a straight heading. This crossed-control
condition causes the airplane to move sideways toward the low wing.
sidestep maneuver (air traffic control). A visual maneuver accomplished by a
pilot at the completion of an instrument approach to permit a straight-in landing
on a parallel runway not more than 1,200 feet to either side of the runway to
which the instrument approach was conducted.
sidestick controller. A cockpit flight control used on some of the fly-by-wire
equipped airplanes. The stick is mounted rigidly on the side console of the
cockpit, and pressures exerted on the stick by the pilot produce electrical signals
that are sent to the computer that flies the airplane.
sidetone (radio transmission). The audio-frequency signal fed back from the
microphone of a radio transmitter into the earphones connected to the radio
receiver. Sidetones allow a person to hear the signal as it is being transmitted.
siemens. A unit of electrical conductance. The siemens has replaced the older
measurement called a mho. One siemens is the amount of electrical conductance
that allows an electromotive force of one volt to move a flow of electrons of one
ampere (one coulomb per second). One siemens is the reciprocal of one ohm.
sight glass (air conditioning system component). A small window in the high
side of a vapor-cycle cooling system. Liquid refrigerant flows past the sight
glass, and if the charge of refrigerant is low, bubbles will be seen. There are no
bubbles in the refrigerant of a fully charged system.
sight glass (liquid-level indicator). A transparent tube on the outside of a
reservoir or tank connected to the bottom of the container. The level of the liquid

in the sight glass is the same as that in the container, and it gives a visual
indication of the level of liquid in the reservoir.
sight line (sheet-metal layout). A line, drawn on a sheet-metal layout, one bend
radius from the bend tangent line. The sight line is placed so it is directly below
the nose of the radius bar in a leaf brake. When the metal is clamped in this
position, the bend tangent line is at the correct position for the beginning of the
bend.

sigma. 14 CFR §401.5: “A single standard deviation from a fixed value, such as
a mean.”
SIGMET (significant meteorological information). A weather advisory issued
concerning weather significant to the safety of all aircraft. SIGMET advisories
cover severe and extreme turbulence, severe icing, and widespread dust or
sandstorms that reduce visibility to less than three miles.
SIGMET (ICAO). Information issued by a meteorological watch office
concerning the occurrence or expected occurrence of specified enroute weather
phenomena which may affect the safety of aircraft operations.
signal generator (electronic test equipment). A piece of electronic test equipment
that produces an electrical signal having a specified voltage, frequency, and
waveform. Signal generators are used for troubleshooting and calibrating
electrical and electronic equipment.
signal-strength meter (radio receiver component). A meter connected into the
automatic volume control (AVC) circuit in a radio receiver. A signal-strength

meter is calibrated in decibels (dB) or in “S” units and is used to provide an
indication of the strength of the signal being picked up by the receiver.

used to trace a signal through each stage of a piece of electronic equipment.
Troubleshooting of malfunctioning equipment is simplified by comparing the
waveform of the signal at each stage with the waveform that should be at that
stage.
signed numbers. A signed number can be either a positive or negative number. A
positive number is a number greater than zero. A negative number is a number
less than zero.
significant digits. The digits of a decimal number, beginning at the first nonzero
digit and extending to the right to include all of the digits needed to give the
required accuracy. One-half expressed as a decimal fraction with one significant
digit is 0.5. If greater accuracy is required, this same value can be expressed with
three significant digits as 0.500.
significant meteorological information. See SIGMET.
significant point (air traffic control). A point, whether a named intersection,
NAVAID, fix derived from a NAVAID(s), or geographical coordinate expressed
in degrees of latitude and longitude, which is established for the purpose of
providing separation, as a reporting point, or to delineate a route of flight.
significant weather prognostic chart. A chart that presents four panels showing
forecast significant weather and forecast surface weather.
silica. Silicon dioxide (SiO2), as it occurs in nature.
silica gel. A form of extremely porous silica used as a desiccant. Silica gel,
packaged in porous paper bags, is stored inside delicate instruments and
electronic equipment that could be damaged by moisture. Moisture in the air is
absorbed and held by the silica gel.
silicon. A dark brown, tetravalent (having four valence electrons), nonmetallic
crystalline chemical element. Silicon’s symbol is Si, its atomic number is 14,
and its atomic weight is 28.086. Silicon is the second most abundant chemical

element in nature (oxygen is the most abundant). Because of the ease with which
silicon unites with oxygen to form silicon dioxide (sand and quartz), it is never
found in nature in its pure state. Silicon is used to make semiconductor diodes,
transistors, and all forms of integrated circuit devices.
silicon carbide. An abrasive that is often ground into small particles and bonded
to sheets of paper or cloth or formed into grinding wheels for use on power
grinders.
silicon controlled rectifier (SCR). A semiconductor electron control device. An
SCR blocks current flow in both directions until a pulse of positive voltage is
applied to its gate. It then conducts in its forward direction, while continuing to
block current in its reverse direction.
silicone. A group of semi-inorganic polymers that have good thermal stability,
are chemically inert, water repellent, and are good lubricants. Silicone products
are available as liquids, solids, and semisolids. They are used in the manufacture
of adhesives, lubricants, sealants, and electrical insulators.
silicone rubber. An elastomeric material made from silicone elastomers. Silicone
rubber is compatible with fluids which attack other natural or synthetic rubbers.
silicon glaze (spark plug contaminant). A form of contamination on aircraft
spark plugs that can lead to engine failure. Silica is found in sand and dust, and if
a carburetor air filter leaks and allows sand or dust to get into the engine, the
silica can form a hard, glasslike deposit on the nose core insulators of the spark
plugs. Silicon glaze is an insulator at low temperatures, and will not cause a
spark plug to show up as bad on a tester. But when the spark plug gets hot, the
silicon glaze becomes conductive, and short circuits the high voltage to ground
before it builds up high enough to jump the gap between the electrodes.
silicon solar cell. A special type of semiconductor device made of P-type silicon
doped with boron and N-type silicon doped with arsenic. When light strikes the
PN junction, electrons flow through the load circuit from the N-silicon to the Psilicon.

steel in sheet form is used for laminations to make up the core of electrical
transformers.

symbol is Ag, its atomic number is 47, and its atomic weight is 107.870. Silver
has the highest thermal and electrical conductivity of any metal, and it is used in
electrical contacts and printed circuits. One of the primary industrial uses of
silver is in photography.
silver brazing. A form of brazing in which the filler metal is a silver-base alloy.
See brazing.
silvered-mica capacitor. A high-voltage capacitor that uses thin sheets of mica as
the dielectric. Both sides of the mica are electrolytically coated with silver. This
silver forms the plates of the capacitor.
silver solder. An alloy of copper, silver, and zinc. The melting point of silver
solder is lower than that of silver, but higher than that of lead-tin solder (soft
solder).
simple flap (airplane flap). A type of wing flap installed on some of the smaller
airplanes. A portion of the trailing edge of the wing inboard of the ailerons can
be folded downward in flight to increase the camber of the wing. This increases
both the lift and the drag the wing produces. See plain flap.

simple fraction (mathematics). A mathematical fraction with whole numbers for
both its numerator and its denominator. An example of a simple fraction is 3 ⁄4.
Fractions that are not simple fractions are called complex fractions. An example
of a complex fraction is:

simple machine. Any of the basic, or elementary, mechanical devices from
which all machines are built. Simple machines include the wheel and axle, the

lever, and the inclined plane.
simple motion. Motion along a straight line, a circular path, or a helix.
simplex. Transmission and reception on the same frequency.
simplex communications. A method of communications in which one station
transmits while the other receives, then the second station transmits and the first
receives. Simplex communications differs from duplex communications, such as
telephone, in which both stations can transmit and receive at the same time.
simplex fuel nozzle (gas turbine engine component). A type of fuel nozzle in a
gas turbine engine in which all of the fuel is fed to the nozzle through a single
fuel manifold.
simplified directional facility (SDF). A NAVAID used for nonprecision
instrument approaches. The final approach course is similar to that of an ILS
localizer except that the SDF course may be offset from the runway, generally
not more than 3°, and the course may be wider than the localizer, resulting in a
lower degree of accuracy.
simulate. To copy something or to make something that represents or acts like
something. When a person is learning to fly an airplane, the flight instructor
simulates every emergency situation the student is likely to encounter. By
experiencing these simulated emergencies under controlled conditions, the
student will know how to act if the real emergency ever occurs.
simulated flameout. A practice approach by a jet aircraft (normally military) at
idle thrust to a runway, with the purpose of simulating a flameout. The approach
may start at a runway (high key) and may continue on a relatively high and wide
downwind leg with a continuous turn to final. It terminates in landing or low
approach.
simulator. A device used for training or research that duplicates a piece of
complex equipment. Flight simulators duplicate the cockpit of an airplane. All of
the controls and instruments are connected to a computer that gives the operator
the feel and the indications that would exist under actual flight conditions in a
real aircraft. Emergency and unusual conditions can be simulated and practiced
in the simulator far more safely and economically than can be done in the real
aircraft.
simultaneous ILS approaches. An approach system permitting simultaneous

ILS/MLS approaches to airports having parallel runways separated by at least
4,300 feet between centerlines. Integral parts of a total system are ILS/MLS,
radar, communications, ATC procedures, and appropriate airborne equipment.
sine (trigonometric function). The sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the
side of a right triangle opposite the angle, to the length of the hypotenuse (the
side opposite the right angle). Sine is abbreviated sin.
sine wave. The waveform of a periodically reversing vibration produced by a
rotating machine in which the instantaneous values of the wave are the peak
value multiplied by the sine of the angle through which the rotating element has
turned.

sine-wave alternating current. Alternating current whose waveform is that
produced by a rotary generator. The instantaneous value of sine-wave voltage is
found by multiplying its peak value by the sine of the angle through which the
rotor of the generator has turned.
For example, when the rotor has turned 30° from the position in which it
produces zero voltage, the instantaneous voltage is one-half the peak voltage (the
maximum voltage it can produce). The sine of 30° is 0.5, or one-half. When the
rotor has turned 45°, the instantaneous voltage is 0.707 time the peak voltage.
The sine of 45° is 0.707. When all of the instantaneous values of sine-wave
alternating current are plotted, a smooth sine curve results.
single-acting actuator (fluid power system). A type of actuator in a fluid power
system that uses fluid under pressure to move it in one direction, but a spring to
return it. Hydraulic brakes use single-acting actuators to move the brake shoes

out against the rotating drum. Hydraulic pressure moves the shoes out, but a
spring pulls them back when the brake pedal is released.
single-action hand pump. A hand-operated fluid pump that moves fluid only
during one stroke of the pump handle. One stroke pulls the fluid into the pump,
and the other forces the fluid out.
single-axis autopilot (aircraft flight control systems). A simple automatic flight
control system that controls the airplane only about its longitudinal, or roll, axis.
The autopilot sensor detects any change in either roll or yaw and sends a signal
to the aileron servos to produce a roll that counteracts the original roll. Singleaxis autopilots are sometimes called wing levelers.
single-cut file (metal-cutting file). A file that has a single row of teeth extending
across its face at an angle of between 65° and 85° to the length of the file.

single direction routes. Preferred IFR routes sometimes depicted on high altitude
enroute charts, which are normally flown in one direction only.
single-disk brake. An aircraft brake in which a single steel disk rotates with the
wheel and rides between two or more pads, or linings. These linings are mounted
in the jaws of a stationary clamp which is closed by hydraulic pressure. When
the brake is applied, the disk is clamped tightly between the linings, and the
resulting friction slows the aircraft and converts energy of motion of the aircraft
into heat.
single engine absolute ceiling. The altitude at which a twin-engine airplane can
no longer climb with one engine inoperative.
single engine service ceiling. The altitude at which a twin-engine airplane can no
longer climb at a rate greater than 50 fpm with one engine inoperative.

structural material in which the damage extends through only one face of the
material and partly into the core.

single flare (rigid tubing flare). A flare made on a piece of rigid tubing in which
there is only one thickness of the tubing material in the flare.
single frequency approach (SFA). A service provided under a letter of agreement
to military single-piloted turbojet aircraft which permits use of a single UHF
frequency during approach for landing. Pilots are not normally required to
change frequency from the beginning of the approach to touchdown, but pilots
conducting an enroute descent are required to change frequency when control is
transferred from the ARTCC to the terminal facility. The abbreviation “SFA” in
the DOD FLIP IFR Supplement under “Communications” indicates this service
is available at an airport.
single-loop rib stitching (aircraft fabric attachment). A method of attaching the
fabric to the wing of an airplane in which only one loop of rib-stitching cord
passes around the rib in each stitch.
single piloted aircraft (air traffic control). A military turbojet aircraft possessing
one set of flight controls, tandem cockpits, or two sets of flight controls but
operated by one pilot.
single-pilot resource management (SRM). The ability of a pilot to effectively
manage all resources to ensure a successful flight outcome.
single-point fueling (aircraft fueling). A method of filling multiple fuel tanks in
large aircraft from a single fueling point. The fuel hose is attached to the fueling
station in the aircraft, and the correct tank valves are opened. Fuel flows into the
tank until either the correct level is reached or the tank is full. Then, fuel to that
tank is automatically shut off. Single-point fueling is fast, efficient, and safe, and
it is used on almost all transport-type aircraft.
single-point grounding (electrical grounding). A method of grounding an
electrical circuit by connecting all of the wires that go to ground to a single point
on the equipment chassis. When single-point grounding is used, there is very
little current flow in the chassis, and the interference from magnetic fields in the
chassis is avoided.
single-servo brake (aircraft brake). A type of brake installed on some aircraft
that uses the momentum of the rotating wheel to wedge the brake shoe tightly
against the brake drum when the aircraft is moving in a forward direction. A
double-servo (duo-servo) brake produces a wedging action between the shoes

and the drum, whether the aircraft is moving forward or backward. A nonservo
brake does not produce a wedging action in either direction.
single-shaft turboprop engine. A turboprop engine in which the propeller
reduction gears are driven by the same shaft which drives the compressor for the
gas generator.
single-shear rivet loading. A joint in which the two sheets of metal are riveted
together. The rivet is subjected to only a single shear load as the sheets try to
slide past one another.

single-sideband radio transmission. A type of radio transmission in which only
one of the sidebands of the signal is transmitted. The other sideband and the
carrier wave are suppressed.
single-spool turbine engine (gas turbine engine). A gas turbine engine that has
only one rotating mass. The compressor is directly connected to the turbine, and
everything rotates at the same speed. A twin-spool turbine engine has a lowpressure compressor driven by one turbine and a high-pressure compressor
driven by another. The two compressors are linked only by the air that flows
through them, and they turn at different speeds.
single spread (adhesive application). A method of adhesive application in which
the adhesive is spread on only one of the two surfaces being joined.
single-throw switch. An electrical switch that has only two conditions, ON or
OFF. In one direction of the operating control, the contacts are open (OFF).
Moving the control to the opposite position closes the contacts (ON). A singlepole, single-throw (SPST) switch can select one of the two conditions in one
circuit, and a double-pole, single-throw (DPST) switch can select one of the two
conditions in two circuits with the movement of a single control.

sintered metal. A type of molded metal in which powdered metal is pressed
together and molded into the desired shape while it is cold. Then the molded
metal is heated to form it into a strong cohesive material.
sintered plate (battery component). A plate of a nickel-cadmium battery made of
powdered metal that has been heated and molded to form a strong, cohesive
material. Sintered material is used because its granular structure gives it a large
surface area.
sintering. A process in which powdered metal is heated but not quite melted and
then squeezed together.
sinusoidal curve. See sine wave.
siphon. A device used to move a liquid from a container, over an edge higher
than the level of the liquid, down to a lower level. A curved tube is put into the
liquid, and some form of mechanical force is applied to start the liquid flowing
through the tube. A suction is often put on the end of the tube to start the liquid
flowing. When the flow is started, atmospheric pressure forces the liquid from
the higher container into the tube, and the weight of the liquid flowing through
the tube to the lower level keeps the liquid flowing.
sister keelsons. Structural members in the front portion of floats lying parallel to
the keel and midway between the keel and chines, adding structural rigidity and
adding to directional stability when on the water.
Sitka spruce. A tall, straight spruce tree that grows on the northern Pacific coast
of North America. Sitka spruce wood is strong, lightweight, and straight grained,
and is used as the reference to which all other aircraft structural woods are
compared.
situational awareness (psychology). The accurate perception and understanding
of all the factors and conditions within the four fundamental risk elements that

affect safety before, during, and after the flight.
situation information (electronic display). Information that directly informs the
pilot about the status of the aircraft system operations or specific flight
parameters including flight path.
sizing (textile materials). A filler put into some types of fabric or paper to fill the
pores and make the material smooth and stiff. Starch is often put into cloth as a
sizing so it will stay smooth when it is ironed.
skeg (seaplane float component). A robust extension of the keel behind the step
which helps prevent the seaplane from tipping back onto the rear portion of the
float.
sketch. A rough drawing made to illustrate a part or principle. Sketches are made
according to regular mechanical drawing practices, but they are usually made
without the use of drawing instruments, and they show only a minimum of
detail.
skew-T chart (or skew-T/log-P diagram). In meteorology, this is a type of
thermodynamic diagram used for the plotting of radiosonde soundings. The
temperature and dew point soundings presented on a skew-T give a profile of the
atmosphere from a point on the ground to about the 100 mb level, showing
atmospheric stability, moisture content, and winds versus altitude. These charts
can help a pilot assess the stability or instability of the atmosphere. See also
thermodynamic diagram.
skid (aircraft flight maneuver). A flight maneuver in which the aircraft is turned
without using a steep enough angle of bank. Centrifugal force caused by the
turning aircraft is not opposed by enough inward lift (from banking), and the
aircraft skids out from its curved flight path away from its direction of turn. A
skid is the opposite of a slip. In a slip, the angle of bank is too steep for the rate
of turn, and the aircraft slides to the inside of the turn.
skid shoes (helicopter landing gear component). Plates attached to the bottom of
skid landing gear protecting the skid.
skids-on-floats (helicopter float design). A type of helicopter float design where
the rigid portion of the landing gear rests on the floats. The floats support the
whole weight of the helicopter in water or on hard surfaces.
skill knowledge. Knowledge reflected in motor or manual skills and in cognitive

or mental skills that manifests itself in the doing of something.
skills and procedures. The procedural, psychomotor, and perceptual abilities
used to control a specific aircraft or its systems. Skills and procedures are the
stick and rudder, or airmanship abilities, that are gained through conventional
training, are perfected, and become almost automatic through experience.
skin. The outside covering of an aircraft airframe.
skin antenna (aircraft antenna). A type of flush antenna (an antenna even with
the surface of the aircraft skin). A part of the metal skin of the aircraft is
electrically isolated by an insulating material and is used as the antenna
conductor. Skin antennas are used on many high-speed aircraft.
skin effect (radio-frequency electrical energy). The cause of the unequal
distribution of radio-frequency alternating current throughout a conductor. AC at
radio frequencies tends to have a greater current density (more current flow) on
the surface of a conductor than it does near the center. Because of skin effect,
some conductors used to carry high radio-frequency AC are hollow tubes.
skin friction (aerodynamic drag). A type of aerodynamic drag caused by air
flowing over the surface of the aircraft. Skin friction is a component of parasite
drag.
skin radiator. A type of radiator used on some of the liquid-cooled racing
airplanes. The radiator is made of two thin sheets of brass, slightly separated so
the heated coolant can flow between them. A skin radiator may be mounted on
the surface of the wing, the sides of the fuselage, or on the floats of seaplanes.
Air flowing over the smooth surface of the radiator removes heat from the
coolant.
skip distance (radio transmission characteristic). The distance from a radio
transmitting antenna to the point on the surface of the earth the reflected sky
wave first touches after it has been bounced off the ionosphere.
ski plane. An airplane whose wheeled landing gear has been replaced with skis
so it can operate from snow or ice. Some types of skis require the wheels to be
removed, and others can be installed without removing the wheels. Retractable
skis have a slot in their bottom surface so they can be pulled up enough for the
wheel to protrude below the ski, enabling the airplane to land on a hard surface
on its wheels.

skipping (seaplane operation). Successive sharp bounces along the water surface
caused by excessive speed or an improper planing attitude when the seaplane is
on the step.
skip welding. A method of welding thin material. Skip welding is done in a
series of short beads, with a space between each bead about as long as one of the
beads. After the first series of beads is made, a second series is made between
each of the first ones. Skip-welded material is less likely to warp than material
welded with one continuous bead. Skip welding is sometimes called step
welding.
ski tuck (flight problem). When skis are not rigged properly or a pilot exceeds
recommended airspeeds, a ski can tuck down and give the momentary downward
rotation of the nose of the aircraft.
skull-cap spinner (propeller spinner). A small, conical, streamlined cover
retained by a bracket attached to the hub of a fixed-pitch wood or metal
propeller. The diameter of a skull-cap spinner is the same as that of the propeller
hub. The spinner serves as a cover over the propeller retaining bolts or nuts and
provides a degree of streamlining.
skunk works. A section of an aircraft factory set aside for research and
development of new aircraft. No one is allowed to visit the skunk works except
those who are actually involved in the project being developed there.
Skydrol hydraulic fluid. The registered trade name of a synthetic hydraulic fluid
used in most modern high-performance aircraft. Skydrol hydraulic fluid has a
phosphate-ester base, is nonflammable, and is usable over a wide range of
temperatures. Skydrol hydraulic fluid meets Military Specifications MIL-H8446.
skyspotter (weather observation). A pilot who has received specialized training
in observing and reporting inflight weather phenomena.
sky wave (radio transmission). The portion of an electromagnetic signal that
radiates upward from the antenna until it strikes the ionosphere, then bounces
back to the earth.
slag (welding product). The hard, brittle, glasslike material that covers a weld
bead that has been made with a coated welding rod. The flux coating on the rod
melts in the heat of the arc and flows out ahead of the bead. The melted flux

covers the metal where the weld is being made and keeps oxides from forming in
the weld. When the weld is made, the liquid flux hardens into slag that must be
chipped off to allow the bead to be inspected.
slam acceleration (gas turbine engine operation). Improper operation of the
power control lever of a gas turbine engine in which the control is moved
forward too quickly to allow the engine to accelerate as it should. There is
danger of a rich flameout if the fuel is metered into the engine before the
compressor is able to pull enough air into the engine to furnish the correct fuelair mixture ratio.
slant-line distance (aircraft navigation). The actual distance between an aircraft
and a ground radio facility. A distance measuring equipment (DME) indicator
shows the slant-line distance between the aircraft and the ground station. Slantline distance is the hypotenuse of a right triangle, with the altitude of the aircraft
as one side, and the horizontal distance between the ground station and a point
directly below the aircraft as the other side.
slant range (radar measurement). The actual distance between a ground-based
radar antenna and an airborne target.
slant visibility (meteorology). The distance an airborne observer can see and
distinguish objects on the ground.
slash (radar indication). A radar beacon reply displayed on a radar scope as an
elongated target.
slat (aircraft control). A secondary control on an airplane that allows the airplane
to fly at a high angle of attack without stalling. A slat is a section of the leading
edge of the wing mounted on curved tracks. These tracks move into and out of
the wing on rollers. In flight at low angles of attack, the air pressure on the wing
holds the slat in, and it forms the leading edge of the wing. At a high angle of
attack, aerodynamic forces pull the slat forward on its tracks, and it forms a duct
that forces the air down onto the top of the wing to keep it from stalling.
slaved compass. A system whereby the heading gyro is “slaved to” or
continuously corrected to bring its direction readings into agreement with a
remotely located magnetic direction-sensing device (usually a flux valve or flux
gate compass).

slaved gyro (aircraft flight instrument). A gyro-stabilized direction indicator
whose directional signals are produced by a flux valve. See flux valve.
sleet. See ice pellets.
slide caliper. A device often used to measure the length of an object. It provides
greater accuracy than a ruler.
slide rule (mathematics). A mechanical calculating device consisting of two
side-by-side logarithmically graduated scales. The graduations are spaced
according to the logarithm of the number, rather than the number itself. Two
numbers are multiplied by adding the lengths of the logarithmic scales
representing the numbers.
Slide rules, which are available in both straight and circular forms, are used to
make fast calculations involving multiplication and division and the use of
logarithms and trigonometric functions. Mechanical slide rules have been almost
totally replaced by electronic calculators that can work all of the problems a
slide rule can work, as well as many other types, much faster and with a far
greater degree of accuracy.
slide switch. A type of electrical switch in which connections are made by
sliding a conductor over fixed contacts.
slide valve. A valve that opens or closes a port by sliding back and forth over it.
Slide valves are used in reciprocating steam engines to open and close the
passage into the cylinder to allow steam to enter and leave.
slide-wire potentiometer. A form of variable resistor in which the amount of
resistance used in a circuit is determined by the position of a contact along a
length of resistance wire. The amount of resistance is directly proportional to the
length of wire in the circuit.
slinger ring (propeller anti-icing system component). A hollow metal ring
mounted around the hub of a propeller so that it turns with it. A mixture of
alcohol and ethylene glycol is pumped into the slinger ring, and centrifugal force
throws the fluid out through short discharge tubes along the leading edges of the
propeller blades. The fluid prevents ice from forming on the blades.
sling psychrometer. An instrument used to measure the relative humidity of the
air. A sling psychrometer consists of two mercury thermometers mounted on a
frame with a handle that allows it to be slung around, so air moves across the

thermometers. The bulb of one thermometer is covered with a cloth wick
saturated with water. As the air blows over it, the water evaporates and lowers
the temperature.
A chart showing the dry-bulb temperature and the difference between the wetbulb and dry-bulb temperatures is used to find the relative humidity, in
percentage, for these conditions.
slip (aircraft flight maneuver). A maneuver in which the aircraft moves through
the air sideways, rather than straight ahead. Slipping produces a large amount of
drag so the airplane can descend at a steep angle without gaining excessive
speed. An airplane is slipped by crossing its controls, using right rudder and left
aileron. A forward slip is one in which the aircraft turns its side into the wind,
but continues in forward flight. A slide slip is one in which the aircraft continues
to point straight ahead, but slips to the side.
slip (induction motor specification). The difference between the synchronous
speed of an induction motor (the speed of the rotating magnetic field in the
stator) and the actual speed the rotor is turning. An induction motor tries to turn
at its synchronous speed, but friction and the mechanical load connected to the
rotor prevent it turning at this speed.
The amount the rotor lags behind the rotating field is called slip. It is slip that
gives the motor its torque. The greater the slip, the greater the pull between the
magnetic fields in the rotor and stator. Slip is measured in percentage of the
synchronous speed.
slip clutch (aircraft starter component). A heavy spring-loaded mechanism built
into an aircraft reciprocating-engine starter that allows the starter drive to slip
enough to take up the initial shock when the starter is engaged. The slip clutch
minimizes the shock that could damage the engine or the starter when the starter
engages.
slip joint (reciprocating engine exhaust system component). A type of
connection used in the exhaust system of a reciprocating engine that provides for
the expansion of the system components as they get hot. The exhaust system is
assembled and connected together with ball joints, bellows, and slip joints that
allow the system to move and not crack. Slip joints fit together loosely when the
system is cold, but tighten when the components reach their operating
temperature.
slippage mark (tires and tubes). A small mark painted between a wheel and a

tube-type tire. The mark is half on the tire and half on the wheel. If the mark on
the tire is not lined up with the mark on the wheel, it shows that the tire has
slipped on the wheel. When a tire slips, the valve in the tube is likely to be
damaged, and the tire should be removed from the wheel and the tube examined.
slip rings (electrical machine). Smooth, continuous rings of brass or copper
mounted on the rotor shaft of an electrical generator or alternator. Current used
to produce the magnetic field in the rotor of a DC alternator flows into the rotor
coil through slip rings. Slip rings also carry current into the deicer heating coils
on an airplane propeller blade.

slip-roll former (sheet metal tool). A type of sheet-metal shop tool used to form
large-radius curves in sheets of metal. Slip-roll formers have three hardened steel
rollers mounted in a framework. One roller, the drive roller, is turned with a
hand crank to pull the metal through the former. The clamp roller is adjustable
up or down to clamp the sheet metal tightly against the drive roller.
The radius roller is adjustable so it can be pressed against the metal to bend it
as the metal is pulled by the clamp roller and drive roller. This determines the
radius of the bend.

slip stick (mathematics). A commonly used term for a slide rule. This name
comes from the fact that most slide rules have a slide that slips in and out of
grooves in the body of the rule.
slipstream (aircraft operation). The strong flow of air moved rearward by an
airplane propeller.
slipstream area. For the purpose of rib stitch spacing, the slipstream area is
considered to be the diameter of the propeller plus one wing rib on each side.
sloshing compound (fuel tank sealant). A rubbery sealant used to line the inside
of built-up metal fuel tanks. The sloshing compound is poured into the tank until
the tank is about half full. The filler cap is installed and the tank rotated until the
compound covers all of the internal surface. Then the compound is drained from
the tank. The compound that sticks to the walls of the tank cures to form a tight
seal over all of the seams in the tank.
slot (aerodynamic component). A fixed, nozzle-like opening near the leading
edge of an airplane wing, ahead of the aileron. A slot acts as a duct to force air
down on the upper surface of the wing when the airplane is flying at a high angle
of attack. Forcing the air down on the top of the wing allows the airplane to fly
at a higher angle of attack before it stalls. Since the slot is located ahead of the
aileron, the aileron remains effective even at very high angles of attack.

slotted flap (aircraft secondary control). A type of trailing-edge flap that forms a
slot between its leading edge and the inside of the flap well in the wing. This slot
directs fast-moving air over the lowered flap and prevents it separating from the
flap upper surface. The air flowing over the top of the flap increases the lift
produced by the wing when the flap is lowered.

slotted-head screw. A screw having a single, straight slot cut across its head for
the blade of a screwdriver to fit.
slotted nut. A regular hexagon nut with slots cut across its top. A cotter pin is
installed through a hole in the shank of the bolt and through the slots in the nut
to safety the nut to the bolt. Slotted nuts differ from castle nuts in that the sides
of slotted nuts are straight, rather than domed.
slow-blow fuse. A special type of fuse that allows a large flow of current for a
short period of time, but opens the circuit if current in excess of its rating flows
for a longer period. Slow-blow fuses are used in electric motor circuits and
circuits with incandescent lamps. Both of these circuits have a large inrush of
current when the switch is first closed, but when the motor begins to turn, or
when the lamp filaments heat up, the current drops to a much lower value.
slow taxi (float plane operation). To taxi a float plane at low power or low RPM.
sludge. A heavy contaminant that forms in an aircraft engine lubricating oil
because of oxidation and chemical decomposition of the oil.
sludge plugs (aircraft reciprocating engine component). Spool-shaped, sheetmetal plugs installed inside hollow crankshaft throws. Sludge carried in the
lubricating oil passing through the crankshaft is thrown by centrifugal force to
the outside of the chamber formed by the sludge plugs, where it is trapped and
held until the engine is disassembled at overhaul.
slug (electrical relay component). A heavy ring of copper or other metal placed
over a relay coil. The slug acts as a short-circuited winding, and the magnetic
field produced by current induced in the slug slows the operation of the relay.
slug (tuned circuit component). A small cylinder of either powdered iron or
copper, placed in the center of a radio-frequency (RF) coil to vary its inductance.
When an iron slug is put in the center of the coil, its inductance increases; but

when a copper slug is put in, its inductance decreases. Changing the inductance
of the coil changes the resonant frequency of the circuit in which the coil is
installed.
slug (unit of mass). The unit of mass equal to that which experiences an
acceleration of one foot per second per second when a force of one pound acts
on it. It is equal to 32.174 pounds, or 14.5939 kilograms, of mass. A slug is also
called a G-pound.

certificated take-off weight.”
small-scale integration (SSI). An integrated circuit chip that contains up to nine
gates or gate-equivalent circuits.
small unmanned aircraft (sUA). 14 CFR Part 1: “An unmanned aircraft
weighing less than 55 pounds, including everything that is onboard or otherwise
attached to the aircraft, and can be flown without the possibility of direct human
intervention from within or on the aircraft.”
small unmanned aircraft system (sUAS). 14 CFR Part 1: “A small unmanned
aircraft and its associated elements (including communication links and the
components that control the small UA) that are required for the safe and efficient
operation of the small UA in the national airspace system.”
smaze (atmospheric condition). A combination of smoke and haze similar to
smog (smoke and fog), except it does not contain as much moisture. Smaze is
generally found in heavily industrialized areas.
smile (sheet metal damage). A small curved dent in the sheet metal around a
rivet head. The smile is caused by the rivet set being held at an angle to the rivet
head, rather than straight in line with the head.
smog (atmospheric condition). A mixture of smoke and fog. Smog is a serious
obstruction to visibility and is basically natural fog contaminated with industrial
pollution.
smoke (meteorology). Restriction to visibility caused by small particles of
carbonaceous material suspended in the air. Smoke is a residue from
combustion.

smoke detector. A device that warns the flight crew of the presence of smoke in
cargo and/or baggage compartments. Some smoke detectors are of the visual
type, others are photoelectric or ionization devices.
smoothing filter (electronic component). An electronic filter, usually made of
capacitors and inductors. A smoothing filter, also called a ripple filter, is
installed between a rectifier and an electrical load to remove the ripple from the
DC produced by the rectifier.
snake drill (sheet-metal-working tool). A long, flexible extension with a round
shank on one end and a drill chuck on the other. The snake drill is fastened in the
chuck of a drill motor, and a twist drill is installed in its chuck. This combination
allows holes to be drilled in locations that are inaccessible to other types of
drills.
snap-action switch (electrical switch). A type of electrical switch whose contacts
are mounted on a spring and held pressed together by the operating handle. As
soon as the handle is moved to the OPEN position, the spring snaps the contacts
apart. Snap-action switches are used in circuits carrying inductive loads to
separate the contacts quickly before the inductance causes an arc to form across
the contacts.
snap ring. A small, spring-steel ring that can be fitted into a groove in a shaft or
in a groove cut into the walls of a hole. The spring action of the ring holds it
tightly in the groove.
snap roll (airplane maneuver). An abrupt maneuver of an airplane in which the
airplane does a single turn of a spin while flying in a horizontal direction.
snips (metal-working hand tool). Hand-operated shears used for cutting sheet
metal. The most generally used snips are called tin snips, because they are
commonly used to cut commercial sheet metal which is often (though
incorrectly) called “tin.”
snow (type of precipitation). A type of precipitation that forms in the air when
water vapor changes directly into crystals of ice. Snow forms when the air
temperature is below 0°C.
snow flurry (meteorology). A popular term for snow shower, particularly of very
light and brief nature.
snow grains (meteorology). Precipitation of very small, white, opaque grains of

ice, similar in structure to snow crystals. The grains are fairly flat or elongated
with diameters generally less than 0.04 inch (1 mm).
snow pellets (meteorology). Precipitation consisting of white, opaque ice
particles that are approximately round or sometimes conical. The particles have a
snowlike structure and are about 0.08 to 0.2 inch in diameter. Snow pellets differ
from snow grains in that they are crisp and easily crushed, and they rebound
from a hard surface and often break up.
snubber (fluid power system component). A component in a hydraulic or
pneumatic actuator that slows the motion of the actuator piston. The snubber
absorbs the shock when the actuator piston reaches the end of its travel.
snubber (instrument component). A restrictor fitting installed between an oil
pressure gage and the pressure pump. A snubber prevents the indicator pointer
from fluctuating.
soak (metal heat treatment). The procedure in which metal being heat-treated is
held in an oven at an elevated temperature until it is heated uniformly
throughout.
soap. A material used for cleaning or as an emulsifier. Soap is made by the
chemical action between the salt of a metal, such as sodium or potassium, and a
fatty oil. Soap assists water in penetrating a film of grease or dirt on a surface so
it can be washed away.
SOAP (Spectrometric Oil Analysis Program). An oil analysis program in which
a sample of oil is burned in an electric arc and an examination is made of the
wavelength composition of the resulting light. Each chemical element in the oil,
when burned, produces light containing a unique band of frequencies. A
computer analyzes the amount of each band of frequencies and prints out the
number of parts of the element per million parts of the entire sample. SOAP can
predict engine problems by warning the engine operator of an uncharacteristic
increase in the amount of any of the elements in the oil.
soap bubble test. A type of test used to check for leaks in almost any kind of
system in which a gas is held under pressure. A soap solution is brushed over all
areas of a pressurized system where a leak could occur, and if there is a leak, the
escaping gas will form bubbles in the soap film.

soapstone. A soft, grayish-white stone composed of talc and chlorite, a mineral
similar to mica. Soapstone has a slick, or soapy, feel that gives it its name.
soaring (aircraft flight). A type of flight in which the aircraft, usually a glider or
sailplane, flies without the use of engine power. The aircraft is normally pulled
into the air with a powered airplane and, when released, it glides down. The pilot
circles in a column of rising air, and as long as the air is rising faster than the
aircraft is descending, the aircraft goes up in altitude. As soon as an altitude is
reached where the air is no longer rising, the pilot leaves that column and
searches out another, to continue the flight.
socket-head bolt. A bolt with a socket, usually hexagon-shaped, formed in its
head. A hexagon wrench that fits into the socket is used to turn a socket-head
bolt.
socket wrench. A type of wrench used to turn a nut or bolt. The socket is a small
cylinder of high-strength chrome-vanadium steel. One end of the cylinder has
either a 6-point or 12-point opening that fits the nut or bolt head. The other end
has a square hole that fits the handle used to drive the socket. These drive holes
are usually 1 ⁄4-inch, 3 ⁄8-inch, 1 ⁄2-inch, or 3 ⁄4-inch square, depending on the size
nut the socket is designed to turn.
Ratchet handles, breakover handles, and speed handles can be used to drive the
socket. Extensions of various lengths, and universal joints may be used between
the socket and the drive handle to allow the socket to fit squarely on the nut and
be turned by the handle.
sodium. A soft, light, malleable, ductile, silvery-white, metallic chemical
element that has a waxy feel. Sodium’s symbol is Na, its atomic number is 11,
and its atomic weight is 22.9898. Sodium is in the alkaline metal group and is
extremely active, combining readily with other chemical elements. Pure sodium
metal combines instantly with oxygen when it is exposed to air, and it causes
water to decompose with a violent reaction. Because of this, sodium metal must
be kept covered with kerosine.
sodium bicarbonate. A white, powdery salt of sodium. When mixed with water,
sodium bicarbonate forms a weak alkaline solution. Sodium bicarbonate is
useful for neutralizing spilled battery acid and as a fire extinguishing agent.
When sodium bicarbonate is heated, it releases carbon dioxide that smothers the
fire. Other names for sodium bicarbonate are baking soda and saleratus.

sodium-filled exhaust valve (reciprocating engine component). A hollow exhaust
valve that is partially filled with metallic sodium. The sodium is a soft solid at
room temperature, but at the operating temperature of the valve, it melts and
becomes a liquid that wets the inside surfaces of the hollow valve stem and head.
As the valve opens and closes, the sodium sloshes back and forth, picking up
heat from the head and carrying it into the stem, where it is transferred through
the valve guide into the cylinder head and is subsequently dissipated into the air.
sodium-vapor lamp. A type of lamp used for outdoor lighting, especially along
highways. Metallic sodium is vaporized inside a glass tube that contains a lowpressure gas. A voltage is placed across electrodes inside the glass tube, and the
gas between the electrodes becomes ionized and glows enough to produce an
orange light.
soft-faced hammer. A hammer whose head has one or more soft faces made of
plastic, rubber, rawhide, or a soft metal such as lead or aluminum. Soft-faced
hammers are used to pound on surfaces that could be damaged by hard hammers.
soft-field landing. A technique for landing on fields that are rough or have soft
surfaces, such as snow, sand, mud, or tall grass. The objective is to touch down
as smoothly as possible, and at the slowest possible landing speed. The pilot
must control the airplane in a manner that the wings support the weight of the
airplane as long as practical, to minimize drag and stresses imposed on the
landing gear by the rough or soft surface.
soft magnetic material. Ferromagnetic material that is easy to magnetize and
demagnetize. Only a small coercive (demagnetizing) force is needed to remove
any magnetism from the material. Low-carbon steel is a soft magnetic material.
soft solder. An alloy of tin and lead that melts at a temperature of less than
800°F (427°C). This temperature is much lower than the melting temperature of
the metal on which the solder is used. Soft solder is normally available in the
form of a hollow wire filled with a resin flux. Soft solder is melted with a hot
soldering copper, called a soldering iron, and the liquid solder wets the surface
on which it is melted. When the soldering iron is removed, the solder solidifies
and forms a bond between the pieces of metal that have been wetted.
Soft solder does not form a physically strong bond, but is used on sheet metal,
over a locked seam to make the joint liquid-proof, or on wires after they have
been twisted together to make a connection having a low electrical resistance.

soft vacuum tube. A vacuum tube that is faulty because air has leaked into the
tube envelope.
software (computer operation). The package of instructions or programs used to
control a computer. Software consists of written instructions that can be easily
changed by a computer programmer. The electronic components, switches, and
wiring used in computer operation are called hardware.
soft X-rays. Low-powered X-rays that have comparatively long wavelengths.
Soft X-rays do not penetrate a material nearly as deeply as the high-powered,
hard X-rays.
soil cement. A material used as a base for roads and airport runways. Soil
cement is made by mixing portland cement with soil and water and then
compacting the mixture.
solar cell. A silicon semiconductor device that converts light energy directly into
electrical energy. These devices are called solar cells because they are designed
to convert energy from the sun directly into electricity.

solar flare. A brief eruption on the surface of the Sun causing a sudden, quick
and intense variation in brightness and radiation. Occurs when built-up magnetic
energy in the solar atmosphere is suddenly released, emitting radiation across
nearly the entire electromagnetic spectrum.
solar radiation. Electromagnetic radiation emitted by the sun.
solar wind. The continuous flow of charged particles and magnetic field (called
“plasma”) away from the sun, due to the very high temperature of the solar
corona and the resultant expansion of the plasma into surrounding space.
solder. See soft solder and silver solder.
soldered splice (electrical wiring connection). A type of splice used for electrical
wires in which the ends of the wires to be joined are twisted together to give

them mechanical strength. The joint is then covered with soft solder to decrease
its electrical resistance. Soldered splices are not generally recommended for use
in aircraft electrical systems.
soldering. A method of thermally joining metal parts with a molten nonferrous
alloy that melts at a temperature below 800°F (427°C). The molten alloy is
pulled up between close-fitting parts by capillary action. When the alloy cools
and hardens, it forms a strong, leak-proof connection.
soldering iron. A handheld tool used to melt solder. Modern soldering irons are
electrically heated and use a tinned copper tip (a copper tip covered with solder)
to melt the solder.
soldering pistol. A special type of handheld tool used to melt solder. The heating
element is a transformer whose secondary winding is a single turn that extends
out of the transformer in the form of two connections for the ends of a copper
tip. When the solder is ready to be melted, a trigger switch in the primary
winding is pulled. When primary current flows, a low voltage but high current is
induced into the single-turn secondary. This current flows through the copper tip
and heats it enough to melt the solder. As soon as the soldered joint is made, the
trigger is released, and the tip cools off.
solderless connector (electrical wires). A crimped-on connector used to fasten a
terminal to an electrical wire.

solenoid. An electromagnet with a movable iron core that can be pulled into the
coil. When current flows in the coil, the resulting magnetic field pulls the core
into its center. When no current is flowing in the coil, a spring moves the core
out of the coil. Solenoids can be used to operate valves, switches, and
mechanical locks, as well as many other types of devices.

solid. A material whose internal structure holds it tightly in its original shape and
size. A solid differs from a liquid, whose structure causes it to hold only its size,
not its shape, and a gas, that holds neither its size nor its shape.
solid conductor (electrical conductor). An electrical conductor made of a single
piece of material, usually wire. Solid conductors are used where vibration is no
problem, but stranded conductors are used where vibration is present.
solid fuel (rocket fuel). Rocket fuel made of a mixture of solid materials that,
when ignited, combine fast enough to produce a great amount of heat. Solid fuel,
which contains all the oxygen needed for the reaction, is molded into a shape
that causes it to burn at the correct rate.
solidity (helicopter rotor system). The ratio of the total blade area to the disk
area. The disk area is the area of the circle swept by the rotor as it rotates.
solidity ratio (helicopter design). The ratio of the total rotor blade area, which is
the combined area of all the main rotor blades, to the total rotor disc area. This
ratio provides a means to measure the potential for a rotor system to provide
thrust.
solid solution (metal heat treatment). A uniform combination of the alloying
elements in a base metal. The alloying elements enter into the solid solution
when the metal is heated in a furnace and held at a high temperature long enough
for the metal to reach a uniform temperature throughout. When the metal is
uniformly hot, it is removed from the furnace and immediately quenched to lock
the alloying elements into the solid solution.
solid-state device. An electronic component that controls the flow of electrons
without the use of any heated filaments, vacuum spaces, or moving parts.
Semiconductor devices such as diodes, transistors, and silicon-controlled
rectifiers are examples of solid-state devices.
solo flight (aircraft flight). Flight of an aircraft when there is only one person in
the aircraft.

soluble. The condition of a substance that can be dissolved in, or can form a
solution with, another substance. Salt is soluble in water, it will dissolve in water
to form a solution of salt and water. Oil is soluble in gasoline. Oil and gasoline
form a solution when they are mixed.
solution. A homogeneous mixture (a mixture that is the same all the way
through) of one or more materials dissolved in another. A solution is a physical
mixture, because the parts that make up the solution do not have to be combined
in any exact ratio, as they do in a compound. Either a little bit, or a large amount
of salt can be dissolved in a container of water, to produce a solution of salt
water.
solution heat treatment (metal heat treatment). A type of heat treatment in which
the metal is heated in a furnace until its temperature is uniform throughout. It is
then removed from the furnace and quenched in cold water. When the metal is
hot, the alloying elements enter into a solid solution with the base metal to
become part of its basic structure. When the metal is quenched, the alloying
elements remain a part of the base-metal structure.
If the metal is not immediately quenched after it is removed from the furnace,
some of the alloying elements will precipitate, or settle out, of the solid solution
with the base metal, and the grain structure will enlarge. The metal will not be as
strong as it would have been if it were properly quenched, and intergranular
corrosion is likely to form along the enlarged grain boundaries.
solvent. A liquid able to dissolve certain types of solids. Water is a good solvent
for some kinds of chemical materials, such as certain types of salts. Alcohol is a
solvent for many materials that cannot be dissolved in water. Some of the
stronger acids, such as hydrofluoric acid, are used as solvents for materials that
cannot be dissolved in any other solvent.
somatogravic illusion (physiology). The feeling of being in a nose-up or nosedown attitude, caused by a rapid acceleration or deceleration while in flight
situations that lack visual reference.
sonar. An electronic detection system used for locating objects in water. Pulses
of acoustic energy (energy whose frequency is within the range that can be heard
by the human ear) is transmitted through the water. This energy travels until it
strikes an object, and part of it is reflected back to the sonar receiver where it is
amplified and displayed on a scope or dial.
Sonar is used by the U.S. Navy to detect the presence of submarines and by

commercial fishermen to locate schools of fish. Passive sonar does not transmit
pulses of energy, but listens for sounds made by the propellers of ships and
submarines.
sonic boom. A loud, explosive noise heard on the ground when an airplane
passes overhead at a speed faster than the speed of sound. Sound-pressure waves
build up as the airplane passes through the air, but because the airplane is flying
faster than these waves can move out ahead of it, the sound pressure builds up
and forms a shock wave.
The shock wave radiates out from the airplane in the form of a cone. When this
cone passes over the ground, the pressure difference between the pressure inside
the wave and the pressure of the surrounding air causes the loud explosion-like
sound.
sonic cleaning. A method of cleaning delicate mechanical parts. The parts are
placed in a sonic cleaning machine and covered with a cleaning fluid. Highintensity sound waves are produced in the cleaning fluid, and the vibrations
caused by these waves shake loose any contaminants on the parts being cleaned.
sonic frequencies. Frequencies of mechanical vibrations that can be heard by the
human ear. Sonic frequencies are normally considered to be those between 20
hertz and 20,000 hertz (20 kHz).
sonic soldering. A method of soldering metals, such as aluminum, that are
normally difficult to solder because of the speed with which surface oxides build
up. The surface to be soldered is covered with a flux to prevent oxygen reaching
it, and the tip of the soldering iron used to heat the surface is vibrated at a sonic
rate. The vibrations loosen the surface oxides, and they float to the top of the
flux. Since no new oxides can form under the molten flux, the solder can reach
the hot, clean metal and adhere to it.
sonic speed. The speed of sound.
sonic venturi. A venturi in a line between a turbine engine compressor or
turbocharger and the pressurization system of an aircraft. When the air flowing
through the venturi reaches the speed of sound, a shock wave forms across the
throat of the venturi and restricts the flow. A sonic venturi is also called a flow
limiter.
soot. A black residue left when a hydrocarbon material is burned in an
atmosphere in which there is not enough oxygen for complete combustion. Soot

is composed mostly of carbon.
sounding (meteorology). An upper-air observation; a radiosonde observation.
sound suppressor. The airframe component that replaces the turbine engine tail
pipe. It decreases the distance sounds made by the exhaust gases can propagate
by converting low-frequency vibrations into high-frequency vibrations.
sound waves. Longitudinal pressure waves within an elastic medium, such as air,
water, or a solid material, that has been disturbed. Sound waves cannot travel
through a vacuum.
source. In communication, the sender, speaker, transmitter, or instructor who
composes and transmits a message made up of symbols which are meaningful to
listeners and readers.
source region (meteorology). An extensive area of the earth’s surface
characterized by relatively uniform surface conditions. Large masses of air
remain long enough over these surfaces to take on characteristic temperature and
moisture properties from the surface.
southern domestic airspace (SDA). All airspace within the Canadian Domestic
Airspace that lies south of a line, that, specifically defined by regulation, begins
at the Alaska/Canada border on the Arctic Ocean and, more or less, extends
southward through Yellowknife to Churchill and thence northeast to Frobisher
and the Atlantic Ocean.
south geographic pole. The location of the southern spin axes of the earth. The
south geographic pole is located at 90° south latitude.
south magnetic pole. The location near, but not at, the south geographic pole, at
which the magnetic lines of flux of the earth’s magnetic field enter. These lines
of flux are considered to leave from the north magnetic pole and enter at the
south magnetic pole.
south pole of a magnet. The pole of a magnet at which lines of magnetic flux are
considered to enter after leaving the magnet at its north pole.
space charge (electron tube). The negative charge in an electron tube between
the cathode and the plate. This space charge is caused by the cloud of electrons
that collect around the cathode of the tube when the cathode emits more
electrons than the plate can accept.

spacers. Components used to fill a space between two objects. Washers are
commonly used as spacers around a bolt to take up the space between the nut
and the surface being clamped by the fastener.
space flight participant. 14 CFR §401.5: “An individual, who is not crew,
carried aboard a launch vehicle or reentry vehicle.”
space shuttle. A manned vehicle launched by a rocket, usually a two-stage
rocket, and carried to an altitude at which it can orbit the earth. At the
completion of its assigned mission, the space shuttle re-enters the earth’s
atmosphere and glides to a landing.
space wave (radio transmission). The portion of an electromagnetic signal that is
capable of traveling through the ionosphere.
spade drill. A special drill used for cutting holes in graphite structural materials.
The flat surfaces of the drill end allow ample room for the drill dust to leave the
hole so it will not abrade the sides of the hole and increase its diameter.

spaghetti (electrical insulation). The commonly used name for a type of
insulating tubing slipped over the end of an electrical wire. The tubing is put on
at the point the wire connects to a terminal, where it is soldered to a component,
or where the wire is spliced. Modern spaghetti is often made of some form of
polyvinyl chloride tubing, and it can be either transparent or color coded. The
name spaghetti comes from the hollow tube of pasta the tubing resembles.
spalling. A type of damage in which chips are broken from the surface of a casehardened material such as a bearing race. Spalling takes place when a bearing
race is put under a load great enough to distort the softer inner part of the metal
and cause the hard, brittle surface to crack. Once a crack forms in the surface,
chips break out.
span loading (aerodynamic measurement). An aerodynamic measurement found
by dividing the span of an airfoil by the total weight the airfoil supports.
spanner. The name generally used by the British for a wrench. In American
usage, a spanner is a special type of wrench with a hook-shaped arm and a hole,

pin, or projection in its hooked end. A spanner is used to turn ring-shaped nuts.
spanner nut. A special type of round nut with holes, notches, or projections
around its periphery. Spanner nuts are turned with a hook spanner or pin
spanner.
span of an airfoil. The length of an airfoil measured between its tips.
spanwise. The distance from tip to tip of an airfoil, wing or stabilizer.
spar (airplane wing component). The main spanwise, load-carrying structural
member in an airplane wing.
spark. An electrical discharge between two electrodes or points within a circuit
having a difference of electrical potential. A spark normally has a very short
duration and produces intense heat, light, and electromagnetic radiation that
cover a wide band of frequencies. A spark is used inside the cylinder of an
internal combustion engine to ignite the fuel-air mixture. A discharge of
lightning is an extremely large spark.
spark coil (reciprocating engine ignition system component). A step-up
transformer used to produce a high voltage. This high voltage causes a spark to
jump across the electrodes of a spark plug inside the cylinder of a reciprocating
engine. The primary winding of the spark coil consists of comparatively few
turns of heavy copper wire, wound over a soft iron core. When primary current
flows through this winding and through the breaker points, a magnetic field is
formed that extends out beyond the secondary winding.
The secondary winding consists of many hundreds of turns of very fine copper
wire wound on the outside of the primary winding. One end of the secondary
winding connects to the primary, and the other end goes to the rotor of the
distributor, a high-voltage selector switch that directs the high voltage to the
proper spark plug.
When the breaker points open, primary current stops flowing, and its magnetic
field instantly collapses. As it collapses, the lines of flux cut across the turns of
wire in the secondary winding and induce a high voltage in it. This high voltage
produces the spark in the spark plug.
spark-ignition engine (reciprocating engine). A form of reciprocating engine in
which the fuel-air mixture inside the cylinder is ignited by an electric spark. The
spark is timed to occur when the piston is in the correct position on the
compression stroke.

spark plug (reciprocating engine ignition system component). A device in the
ignition system of a reciprocating engine that produces the spark which ignites
the fuel-air mixture inside the cylinder. A spark plug has a steel shell and an
insulated center electrode. Accurately spaced gaps are formed between the
ground electrodes on the shell and the insulated center electrode.
The high-voltage lead from the ignition distributor is connected to the insulated
terminal of the spark plug and, at the correct time, a pulse of high-voltage
electrical energy is sent to the spark plug. As this electrical energy passes to
ground, it produces an intense spark between the two electrodes.
spark plug bushing (aircraft reciprocating engine component). A threaded bronze
or steel bushing screwed and shrunk into an opening in the cast aluminum
cylinder head of an aircraft engine. The spark plugs screw into the bushings
which protect the soft aluminum from damage when the spark plugs are
changed.
spark plug resistor. A resistor installed in a shielded spark plug between the
ignition lead terminal and the center electrode. The capacitance in the shielded
ignition lead stores enough energy to keep the spark flowing across the gap long
enough to erode the electrodes. The resistor decreases the duration of the spark
and thus minimizes electron erosion.
spark suppressor. A device placed across a set of electrical contacts to suppress
the spark that forms when the contacts open. Spark suppressors normally consist
of a capacitor and resistor and sometimes a diode across the contacts.
spark test (metal identification method). A quick test to identify types of ferrous
metal. A sample of the metal is pressed against a grinding wheel, and the pattern
of sparks thrown off indicates of the type of metal. When wrought iron which
contains no carbon is held against the wheel, the sparks stream out in a straight
line. The lines of sparks grow wider and brighter as they stream out behind the
wheel.
Mild steel, with its low carbon content, has a spark pattern similar to that of
wrought iron, except some of the sparks have tiny forks on them. The spark
pattern for tool steel with its high-carbon content is similar to that for mild steel,
except there are more forks in the stream, and the forked sparks form close to the
wheel. Cast iron produces a large number of sparks close to the wheel, but they
die out quickly. The spark pattern for cast iron is very short.

spar varnish. A hard, durable finish for wood that is to be kept outdoors where it
is exposed to the weather. Spar varnish is made of a resin mixed with drying oils
and thinners, and it is brushed on the surface to be protected. When the drying
oils cure, they leave a hard, protective resin film on the wood. Spar varnish is
much more durable than spirit varnish.
spatial disorientation (physiology). The state of confusion due to misleading
information being sent to the brain from various sensory organs, resulting in a
lack of awareness of the aircraft position in relation to a specific reference point.
spatula. A tool that looks much like a knife, but has no cutting edge. The thin,
flexible, metal blade of a spatula is used to mix, spread, or move soft materials,
such as resins.
speaker voice coil. A small coil that rides inside an air gap in a permanent
magnet or electromagnet inside a radio speaker. The voice coil is physically
attached to the speaker cone, and alternating current from the output of an audio
amplifier flows through it. Current flowing in the voice coil produces a magnetic
field that either aids or opposes the magnetic field in which the coil is mounted.
This interaction between the magnetic fields moves the coil in and out, and as it
moves, it vibrates the speaker cone and produces sound waves in the air.
“speak slower” (air traffic control). Used in verbal communications as a request
to reduce speech rate.
special activity airspace (SAA). Any airspace with defined dimensions within
the National Airspace System wherein limitations may be imposed upon aircraft
operations. This airspace may be restricted areas, prohibited areas, military
operations areas, air ATC assigned airspace, and any other designated airspace
areas.
special emergency (air traffic control). A condition of air piracy or other hostile
act by a person or persons aboard an aircraft which threatens the safety of the
aircraft or its passengers.
special flight permit. A flight permit issued to an aircraft that does not meet
airworthiness requirements but is capable of safe flight. A special flight permit
can be issued to move an aircraft for the purposes of maintenance or repair,
buyer delivery, manufacturer flight tests, evacuation from danger, or customer
demonstration. Also referred to as a ferry permit.

special flight rules area (SFRA). An airspace region in which the normal
regulations of flight do not apply in whole or in part, especially regarding
regulations for airspace classification, altitude, course, and speed restrictions.
special instrument approach procedure. A procedure approved by the FAA for
individual operators, but not published in 14 CFR Part 97 for public use.
special light-sport aircraft. An aircraft issued a special airworthiness certificate
in accordance with 14 CFR §21.190 in the light-sport category. These aircraft
meet the ASTM industry-developed consensus standards.
special use airspace. Airspace in which flight activities are subject to restrictions
that can create limitations on the mixed use of airspace wherein activities must
be confined because of their nature and/or wherein limitations may be imposed
upon aircraft operations that are not a part of those activities. Refers to
prohibited, restricted, warning, controlled firing, military operations, and alert
areas.
Special Use Airspace Management System (SAMS). A joint FAA and military
program designed to improve civilian access to special use airspace by providing
information on whether the airspace is active or scheduled to be active. The
information is available to authorized users via an Internet website.
special VFR. 14 CFR Part 1: “Meteorological conditions that are less than those
required for basic VFR flight in controlled airspace and in which some aircraft
are permitted flight under visual flight rules.”
special VFR operations. 14 CFR Part 1: “Aircraft operating in accordance with
clearances within controlled airspace in meteorological conditions less than the
basic VFR weather minima. Such operations must be requested by the pilot and
approved by ATC.”
specific fuel consumption. A measure of the amount of fuel burned in a heat
engine to produce a given amount of power. Specific fuel consumption of a
reciprocating engine is expressed in pounds of fuel burned per hour for each
horsepower produced.
specific gravity. The ratio of the density of a material to the density of pure
water. If the specific gravity of a material is less than 1.0, it will float in water,
but if it is greater than 1.0, it will sink.
specific heat. The ratio of the amount of heat energy needed to raise the

temperature of a specific mass of material one degree Celsius, to the amount of
heat energy needed to raise the temperature of the same mass of pure water one
°C. Water has a specific heat of 1.0, and copper has a specific heat of 0.093.
Therefore, it takes 10.75 (
) times as much heat to raise the temperature of
one gram of water one °C as it does to raise the temperature of one gram of
copper one °C.
specific humidity (meteorology). The ratio, by weight, of the water vapor in a
sample of air to the combined weight of the water vapor and the dry air.
specific thrust (turbine engine parameter). A measure of performance for
turbojet and turbofan engines. It is the ratio of pounds of net thrust developed to
the pounds of mass airflow per second.
specific weight (aircraft engine measurement). The ratio of the weight of an
aircraft engine to the brake horsepower it produces.
specific weight of air. 0.07651 pounds per cubic foot.
spectrometric oil analysis. See SOAP (Spectrometric Oil Analysis Program).
spectrophotometer. A device for measuring light intensity that can measure
intensity as a function of the color, or more specifically, the wavelength of light.
speech scrambler (communications device). A security device used with a radio
transmitter to make voice transmissions unintelligible to anyone not having the
correct descrambling equipment and the correct code for the day. The scrambler
circuit modifies the voice signals being transmitted so they no longer resemble
the original sound. When the signals are received by the intended receiver, they
are passed through a descrambler that changes them back into their original
form.
speed. The rate of motion. Speed, which is the distance an object travels in a
given length of time, is expressed in such terms as miles per hour, kilometers per
hour, knots (nautical miles per hour), feet per second, or meters per second.
Speed, unlike velocity, does not take into consideration the direction of travel.
speed adjustment (air traffic control). An ATC procedure used to request pilots
to adjust aircraft speed to a specific value for the purpose of providing desired
spacing. Pilots are expected to maintain a speed of plus or minus 10 knots or
0.02 Mach number of the specified speed.

speed brakes (aircraft control). A type of secondary control on an airplane, a
control which does not rotate the aircraft about any of its three axes. Speed
brakes produce drag without affecting lift, or causing the aircraft to pitch. The
drag they produce allows a highly streamlined airplane to descend at a steep
angle without picking up excessive speed.
speeder spring (propeller governor component). A compression spring in a
propeller governor that balances the centrifugal force acting on the flyweights to
route oil to or from the propeller to maintain the desired engine RPM. The
compression of the spring is controlled by the pilot through the propeller pitch
control.
speed instability. A condition in the region of reverse command in which a
disturbance that causes the airspeed to decrease causes total drag to increase,
which in turn causes the airspeed to decrease further.
speed of light. The speed at which light travels in a vacuum. The speed of light is
299,792.5 kilometers per second, or 186,282 miles per second.
speed of sound. The speed at which the mechanical vibrations of sound travel in
an elastic medium. Sound travels in air, under standard atmospheric conditions,
at a rate of 760 miles per hour, 340 meters per second, 1,108 feet per second, or
658 knots. The speed of sound is affected by the density of the medium through
which it travels. In the air this is determined by the air temperature.
speed-rated engine (gas turbine engine specification). A gas turbine engine
whose rated thrust is produced at a specified RPM.
speed segments (air traffic control). Portions of the arrival route between the
transition point and the vertex along the optimum flight path for which speeds
and altitudes are specified. There is one set of arrival speed segments adapted
from each transition point to each vertex, and each set may contain up to six
segments.
speed sense. The ability to instantly sense and react to any reasonable variation
of airspeed.
speed-sensitive switch (turbine engine control component). A component in a
turbine engine fuel control that selects the desired reference speed for startlimiting operation during initial engine starting. The electronic control remains

in the start-limiting condition until the speed switch opens. At this point the
electronic control switches to normal limiting temperature operation.
speed to fly. Optimum speed through a (sinking or rising) air mass to achieve
either the furthest glide or fastest average cross-country speed depending on the
objectives during a flight.
sphere. A solid with a curved surface, like a ball. All points on the surface of the
sphere are the same distance from a point within the sphere called its center.
spider (propeller component). The high-strength steel component in an airplane
propeller that attaches to the propeller shaft of the engine and supports the
propeller blades. The spider and the roots of the blades are enclosed in the highstrength propeller hub.
spike (electrical disturbance). A transient condition in an electrical circuit in
which a pulse of electrical energy with a high voltage and short duration appears
in the circuit. Spikes are produced when an inductive load in the circuit is
interrupted, and by induction from an outside source, such as a flash of lightning.
Special spike-protection circuits are installed in critical electronic equipment to
prevent damage from spikes.
spike knot (wood defect). A knot that runs through the depth of a beam,
perpendicular to the annual rings. Spike knots appear most frequently in
quartersawed wood.
spin (aircraft maneuver). A maneuver of an airplane in which one wing is stalled
while the other wing continues to produce lift. An airplane is put into a spin by
getting it very nearly into a stall and then quickly rotating it about its vertical
axis by pushing on one of the rudder pedals.
As the airplane rotates about its vertical axis, one wing moves backward and
stalls. The other wing moves forward and picks up a bit of extra lift. The nose
drops, and the airplane descends slowly, with the wing producing lift pulling it
around in a spiral path. To recover from a spin, the nose is forced down so air
flows over the stalled wing. With both wings producing lift, the airplane
recovers from the spin.
spinner (aircraft propeller component). A streamlined housing over the hub of
the propeller. A spinner smoothes the airflow as it enters the cooling openings in
the engine cowling. It also gives the airplane a streamlined shape.

spin training (flight training). Training on stall awareness, spin entry, spins, and
spin recovery procedures.
spiral (aircraft maneuver). A maneuver in which an airplane descends in a
steeply banked, turning flight path. A spiral is sometimes confused with a spin,
but the two maneuvers are totally different. In a spin, one wing is stalled and the
other is producing lift, while in a spiral, both wings produce lift. The airspeed
does not increase as an airplane spins, but in a spiral, the speed can increase to a
dangerous level if the spiral is allowed to continue.
spiraling slipstream. The slipstream of a propeller-driven airplane spirals around
the airplane. This slipstream strikes the side of the vertical fin, causing the
aircraft to yaw slightly. Fin offset is sometimes used by aircraft designers to
counteract this tendency.
spiral instability. A condition that exists when the static directional stability of
the airplane is very strong compared to the effect of its dihedral in maintaining
lateral equilibrium.
spirit level. An instrument used to determine whether or not something is level,
or perpendicular to a line that points directly toward the center of the earth. A
spirit level is a curved glass tube partially filled with liquid. Enough liquid is left
out of the tube so there is a bubble in it. The tube is mounted in a long, straight
metal or wood bar in such a way that when the bar is level, the bubble in the
liquid is in the center of the tube. Spirit levels are also called bubble levels.
spirit varnish. A finishing material for wood made of a resin dissolved in a
volatile solvent such as alcohol. The varnish is brushed or sprayed on a surface,
and it forms a hard, resin film when the solvent evaporates from it.
splayed patch (plywood patch). A type of patch made in an aircraft plywood
structure in which the edges of the patch are tapered for approximately five
times the thickness of the plywood. A splayed patch is not recommended for use
on plywood less than 1 ⁄10-inch thick.
splice connector (electric wiring). A solderless, crimped-on connector used to
join two wire ends. The splice connector is made in the form of an insulated
metal tube. The insulation is stripped from the ends of the wires to be spliced,
and the bare wire is slipped into the tube. The tube is then crimped onto the wire.
A solderless splice connector forms a joint that is physically as strong as the

wire, and it has an extremely low electrical resistance. See illustration for
solderless connectors.
splice knot (aircraft covering material). A special knot used to join two pieces of
waxed rib-stitching cord. A splice knot is superior to a square knot because it
will not slip.
splined propeller shaft (reciprocating engine component). A propeller shaft with
splines along its periphery that fit into mating splines in the steel propeller hub.
A splined propeller shaft is indexed to the hub by a master spline which allows
the propeller to be installed with only one orientation to the engine crankshaft.

splines. A method of locking a shaft into a wheel or disk. A number of equally
spaced parallel slots are cut lengthwise into the surface of a shaft. Matching slots
are cut in the inside surface of the hole into which the shaft fits, and the splines
prevent the shaft rotating in the hole.
split (wood defect). A longitudinal crack in a piece of wood caused by externally
induced stress.
split bus. A type of electrical bus that allows all of the voltage-sensitive avionic
equipment to be isolated from the rest of the aircraft electrical system when the
engine is being started or when the ground-power unit is connected.
split duty. In flight operations, this is a flight duty period that has a scheduled
break in duty that is less than the required rest period.
split-field motor. A reversible DC electric motor that has two separate field
windings; one for clockwise rotation and the other for counterclock-wise
rotation.
split flaps (aircraft controls). A type of wing flaps in which a part of the under
side of the wing or the trailing edge of the wing splits and folds down to increase
the curvature (camber) of the bottom of the wing. The increased camber

increases the drag and also the lift produced by the wing under low-speed flight
conditions.

split lock washer. A heavy spring-steel washer split at an angle across its face
and twisted. When a nut is tightened down over a split lock washer, the twist is
flattened out, and the spring action of the washer pushes against the nut and
holds its threads tight against the threads of the bolt. This pressure between the
threads prevents vibration from loosening the nut.
split needles (helicopter instrument indication). The indication on a helicopter
tachometer that shows the rotor clutch is not fully engaged. A helicopter
tachometer has two needles; one shows the speed of the engine and the other, the
speed of the main rotor. When the clutch is fully engaged and the rotor is
coupled to the engine, the needles are “married”—one is directly on top of the
other. When the engine is started and the rotor is coming up to speed, the engine
RPM needle is ahead of the rotor RPM needle. When the engine is throttled
back, and the rotor freewheels, the rotor needle is ahead of the engine needle. In
either case, the needles are said to be split.
split-phase induction motor. A type of alternating current motor that has a main
and an auxiliary winding connected in parallel. The phase of the current flowing
in the auxiliary, or start, winding is shifted from that flowing in the main
winding, either by a capacitor or by a large difference in the resistance in the two
windings. The phase difference between the current flowing in the two field
windings produces a rotating magnetic field which starts the rotor spinning.
When the rotor is spinning at a specified speed, a centrifugal switch opens the
auxiliary-winding circuit, and the motor operates with only the main winding.

split-rocker switch. An electrical switch whose operating control is a rocker,
split so one-half of the switch can be opened without affecting the other half.
Split-rocker switches are used as aircraft master switches. The battery can be
turned on without turning on the alternator, but the alternator cannot be turned
on without also turning on the battery. The alternator can be turned off without
turning off the battery, but the battery cannot be turned off without also turning
off the alternator.

split spool compressor (turbine engine component). An axial flow compressor
that has two independent spools driven by two separate stages of turbines. The
speed of the aft, or high-pressure stage (N2), is controlled by a governor and the
fuel control, while the speed of the forward, or low-pressure stage (N1), is not
governed and it seeks its own best speed.
spoiler (aircraft control). A small deflector that can be raised into the air flowing
over an airfoil. When a spoiler is raised into the airstream, it disturbs the smooth
flow of air and destroys part of the lift the airfoil is producing. Spoilers are used
on high-performance sailplanes to decrease the lift so they will not float during
landing.
spokeshave (wood-cutting tool). A short drawknife with handles on each end.
The spokeshave cuts as the blade is drawn toward you. A spokeshave is used for
rounding the edges of strips of wood. The name comes from its use in shaping
the wooden spokes used in the wheels of horse-drawn wagons.
spongy brakes (hydraulic brake condition). The feel of the brake pedal when the
hydraulic brake fluid contains air. In normal operation, the brake system is filled
with noncompressible brake fluid, and the pedal has a firm feel. But if there is
any air in the fluid, the air compresses when the pedal is depressed and gives the
pedal a spongy feel.
sponson (aircraft structure). A surface much like a short stub wing that extends
out on the side of a flying boat hull near the waterline. Sponsons keep the flying

boat level when it is not moving through the water, and they also give it stability
and provide some aerodynamic lift.
spontaneous combustion. Self-ignition of a material caused by heat produced in
the material as it combines with oxygen from the air. If oily rags are left in a
bundle, the heat produced when oxygen in the air reacts with the oil cannot be
carried away. The rags get hot enough to burst into flames. They are ignited by
spontaneous combustion.
spoofing. The action by pilots and air traffic controllers to recognize the onset of
GPS interference, by using relevant ground-based legacy navigational aids
which are tuned and available to maintain situational awareness.
spool (turbine engine component). An axial-flow compressor. Some engines
have two or three independent spools, each of which is driven by its own stages
of turbines.
sport pilot certificate. An FAA-issued pilot certificate allowing the holder to
operate a light-sport aircraft in the category, class, make, and model for which
they are endorsed to do so.
spot check. A method of manufacturing inspection in which only a certain
percentage of the products are checked. The products to be checked are selected
from the production line in a random fashion, so those checked are typical of the
entire production run.
spot-facing. A smooth, flat, circular area around a bolt hole that provides a good
seat for the bolt head or for a washer under the bolt head.
spotlight. A lighting device that produces a brilliant, concentrated beam of light.
Spotlights are used for searching an area at night, because they concentrate the
light energy in a small area that allows the beam to extend out for a great
distance.
spot welding. A form of electrical resistance welding used for thin sheets of
metal. The metal parts are assembled and clamped between the electrodes of the
spot welding machine. A timed pulse of current flows between the electrodes
and melts a spot of the metal. Pressure on the electrodes forces the molten metal
from the two sheets together to form a single spot which joins the sheets. Fuel
tanks can be welded with a continuous, leakproof seam by allowing the spots to
overlap each other.

spout. A pipe or similar device used to carry a liquid from a container in a
stream that is easy to control.
sprag clutch. A form of freewheeling clutch used in the rotor-drive system of a
helicopter. The sprag clutch allows the engine to drive the rotor, but, when the
engine power is reduced, the clutch allows the rotor to freewheel, and prevents it
trying to drive the engine.
spray gun (cleaning tool). A type of maintenance tool used for cleaning parts.
Compressed air is blown through the spray gun, and as it passes through a
venturi, it produces a low pressure. This low pressure picks up a cleaning
solution, such as varsol or naphtha, and sprays it out in the form of tiny drops
onto the surface being cleaned. The combined solvent action of the cleaning
solution and the force of the high-pressure air removes dirt, grease, or other
contaminants from the surface.
spray gun (paint spray gun). A device that breaks a liquid finishing material,
such as paint or lacquer, into tiny drops and blows them onto the surface being
painted. Two basic types of paint spray guns are: suction-feed and pressure-feed
guns. A suction-feed gun uses suction produced by venturi action inside the gun
to pick up the finishing material from a cup attached to the gun. The material
sprayed by a pressure-feed gun is forced into the gun by air pressure on the fluid
stored in a pressure cup or pressure pot.
spray rails. Metal flanges attached to the forward inboard portions of the chines
on the floats of a seaplane, intended to reduce the amount of water spray thrown
into the propeller.
spray strip (water craft). Small strips of metal mounted on the side of a flying
boat hull or seaplane floats. Spray strips throw a spray of water out away from
the aircraft and reduce the amount of spray thrown into the propeller.

spreader bar (aircraft floats). Horizontal structural members between the two
floats mounted on an aircraft.
springback (aircraft control system). A method used to ensure that the control
arm of a device being controlled actually reaches its full-travel stop. There are
stops on both ends of an aircraft throttle control. The stop on the carburetor must
be contacted first, then the throttle control is moved farther until its stop in the
cockpit is reached. This additional movement stretches the control mechanism,
and when the throttle control is released, it springs back a slight amount.
Technicians often refer to this type of control adjustment as “rigging in the
proper cushion.” Springback ensures that the stop on the carburetor is contacted
before the stop in the cockpit.

springback (sheet metal forming). Springback, in sheet metal forming, is the
tendency of the metal to spring back and form an angle less than the angle bent
in a brake or a forming block. When a 90° angle is to be bent, the metal must be
bent through an angle of about 93° or 94° (depending upon the temper of the
metal) so it will spring back to exactly 90°.
spring-loaded. Components are spring-loaded when one part is held tightly
against another by the force of a spring. Relative movement is allowed but the
spring returns the parts to their original position.
spring steel. High-carbon steel, a steel containing more than 0.5% carbon, that
has been hardened and tempered to give it the maximum amount of elasticity, or
the ability to return to its original shape after it has been deflected. Spring steel is
hardened and then tempered to remove part of the brittleness by reheating until it
turns a uniform dark blue.

spring tab (aircraft controls). A small auxiliary tab, set into the trailing edge of a
primary control surface on a high-speed airplane. The control surface is attached
to the control horn through a torsion rod. Under normal flight loads, the spring
tab remains fixed to the control surface and serves no purpose. But, when the air
loads are high and a large amount of force is needed to move the control surface,
the torsion rod twists, and the control rod moves the spring tab in a direction
opposite to that of the surface on which it is mounted. It then acts as a servo tab
and aids the pilot in moving the control surface. See servo tab.

springwood. The lighter, softer part of the grain of wood. The heavier and darker
part of the wood grain is the summerwood. The cross section of a tree trunk
contains a series of concentric rings, called annual rings. Each ring is made up of
a light and a dark area. The light area is the part of the tree that grew at a fast rate
in the spring of the year and is called the springwood. The dark area is the part of
the tree that grew more slowly during the summer of the year and is called
summerwood.
sprue (casting). A hole in a mold through which liquid plastic or molten metal is
poured to fill the mold. When the molded material becomes solid, the mold is
opened, and the metal which was in the sprue (this metal is also called a sprue) is
broken from the casting and discarded.
spur and pinion reduction gear system. A type of reduction gear system that
allows one shaft to turn at a speed slower than that of another shaft. A pinion is a
small-diameter spur gear, whose teeth mesh with those on the larger-diameter
gear. The pinion turns faster than the larger gear, and it turns in the direction
opposite to that of the larger gear.

spur gear. A gear wheel with teeth radiating outward around its periphery. The
term spur gear comes from the fact that this type of gear looks much like the
rowel, or toothed wheel, that was a part of the spur worn by many of the earlyday cowboys.
spur gear pump. A form of constant-displacement fluid pump
meshing spur gears mounted in a close-fitting housing. Fluid is
housing where it fills the space between the teeth of the gears
around the housing as the gears rotate.
On the discharge side of the pump, the teeth of the two gears
fluid is forced out of the pump.

and is carried
mesh, and the

squall (meteorology). A sudden increase in wind speed by at least 15 knots to a
peak of 20 knots or more, and lasting for at least one minute. The essential
difference between a gust, lasting less than one minute, and a squall is the
duration of the peak speed.
squall line (meteorology). Any nonfrontal line or narrow band of active
thunderstorms with or without squalls.
square (geometric figure). A closed, plane (flat), four-sided figure. Each angle in
a square is a right angle (90°), all sides have the same length, and the opposite
sides of a square are parallel.
square drive (mechanical coupling). A mechanical coupling in which the driving
element is square and it fits into a square hole in the driven element. Square
drives are used between a socket wrench and the handle that turns it.

square engine (reciprocating engine). A reciprocating engine whose bore and
stroke have the same dimensions. The bore of the engine is the diameter of the
cylinders, and the stroke is the distance the piston moves from the top of its
travel to the bottom.
square mil. A unit of area possessed by a square having sides of one mil, or one
thousandth of an inch (0.001 inch).
square of a number (mathematics). The product of a number multiplied by itself.
square root (mathematics). A number which, when multiplied by itself, will give
a particular number.
square wave (electrical waveform). The waveform produced by pulsating direct
current in which the voltage alternates between zero and its maximum value. It
changes almost instantaneously from zero to its maximum value, remains at this
value for a given period of time, and then returns instantly to zero. The length of
time the voltage remains at maximum is the same as the time it remains at zero.
Alternating current can also have a square wave if the voltage changes almost
instantaneously from its maximum positive value to its maximum negative
value. The voltage at both the maximum positive and the maximum negative
values remains constant until it shifts to the opposite value. The voltage remains
positive for the same length of time it remains negative.

square-wave generator (electronic device). An electronic device that produces
alternating current with a square waveform. The frequency and the amplitude of
the square-wave AC can be changed to any value desired.
squaring shear (sheet metal shop tool). A large shear used to make straight cuts
across a sheet of metal. Squaring shears used for light-gage steel and thin
aluminum alloy sheets are operated by a foot pedal, and shears used to cut heavy
plate steel are operated by energy stored in a large flywheel by a small electric
motor.

squat switch (aircraft safety switch). A switch mounted on the shock strut of an
aircraft landing gear. The squat switch is in a circuit whose actuation depends
upon the configuration of the landing gear. For example, the squat switch
prevents the landing gear retraction handle being moved any time weight is on
the landing gear. A squat switch can also be installed in the cabin pressurization
system to prevent the cabin being pressurized if the airplane is on the ground and
weight is on the landing gear.
“Squawk” (air traffic control). A term used by ATC to request a pilot to activate
specific modes, codes, or functions on the aircraft transponder. For example,
“squawk three/alpha, two one zero five, low.”
“Squawk ident” (air traffic control). A phrase used by ATC to request a pilot to
activate the ident feature on the aircraft transponder. Activation of the ident
feature allows the ground controller to immediately identify the aircraft that is
squawking.
squealer tip (compressor blade tip). See profile tip.
squeegee. A rubber scraper blade mounted on a handle in such a way that the
blade forms a T with the handle. Squeegees are used to move a liquid over a
surface. Some of the common uses for squeegees are removing water from a
window after the window has been washed, spreading paint through the open
fibers in a silk screen, and removing water from a photographic print after it has
been washed.
squeeze bottle. A bottle made of a soft plastic material. The contents of the bottle
can be forced out through a small opening in the cap by squeezing the sides of
the bottle.
squeeze riveter. A power riveting tool used to install solid aluminum alloy rivets
in a sheet metal structure. The squeeze riveter can be made in the form of a Cclamp or an alligator clamp. One jaw of either type clamp is a fixed part of the
riveter frame, and the other jaw is moved against the fixed jaw by the piston in
an air cylinder.
The fixed jaw is fitted with a rivet set that fits the manufactured head of the
rivet, and the movable jaw is flat. Shims are placed under the rivet set so the
jaws come close enough together to form a shop head of the correct thickness.
Squeeze riveting is fast, and rivets are more uniform than those driven by a rivet
hammer and bucking bar.

squelch circuit (radio receiver circuit). A circuit in a radio receiver that keeps the
volume down when no signal is being received. As soon as a signal is received,
the squelch circuit allows it to come through loud enough to be comfortably
heard. Squelch circuits are used in communications radios that receive long
periods of silence between transmissions.
squib (fire extinguishing system component). A small explosive charge that
drives a cutter through the seal in a high-rate discharge (HRD) bottle of fire
extinguishing agent. The container of fire extinguishing agent is sealed with a
thin metal diaphragm. When the operator presses the AGENT RELEASE switch
in the cockpit, the squib is ignited. As the squib burns, it produces enough gas
pressure to drive a cutter through the metal diaphragm and release the agent into
the fire extinguishing system.
squirrel-cage induction motor. A type of AC motor whose rotor has current
induced into it from stationary field coils. The rotor is made of a stack of soft
iron laminations, mounted on a steel rotor shaft. Heavy copper end plates are
fastened to the shaft at each end of the stack of laminations. Copper bars fit into
slots in the laminations and are welded to each of the end plates.
Changing magnetic fields, caused by AC flowing in the stator windings, induce
a large amount of current into the low-resistance bars and the end plates. This
current produces a strong magnetic field that reacts with the field in the stator,
and the squirrel-cage rotor spins inside the stator. The speed of the rotor is
determined by the frequency of the alternating current flowing in the stator
windings.
squitter (ATC transponder signal). (1) A signal transmitted by an ATC
transponder without it being interrogated. The squitter does not interrogate other
aircraft. (2) The term refers to a system designed to transmit and receive signals
from a transponder, without active interrogation of the transponder. It also refers
to a signal transmitted by the system. TCAS II requires a Mode S transponder,
which is interrogated by other TCAS II equipment and replies to that equipment.
A squitter system would be able to transmit and receive any information from
the transponders, but it would not actively interrogate other aircraft as a TCAS II
would.
SRM. See single-pilot resource management.
SRM (Structural Repair Manual). A maintenance manual issued by a
manufacturer and approved by the FAA that describes, in detail, specific repairs

that are approved for a particular aircraft structure.
SSR. See secondary surveillance radar.
SSV. See standard service volume.
stabilator (aircraft primary flight control). A single-piece horizontal tail surface
on an airplane which serves the purposes of both the horizontal stabilizer and the
elevators. A stabilator must have some method of decreasing its sensitivity, and
this is done with an antiservo tab on its trailing edge. The antiservo tab
automatically moves in the same direction as the stabilator, and the aerodynamic
force it produces opposes the movement of the stabilator.
stability (aircraft flight condition). The characteristic of an aircraft that causes it
to return to its original attitude after it has been disturbed from this condition.
stability (meteorology). A state of the atmosphere in which the vertical
distribution of temperature is such that a parcel of air will resist displacement
from its initial level.
stability characteristics, maximum speed for (VFC/MFC). An aircraft’s designed
stability characteristic V-speed limitation, which represents a speed value
midway between the maximum operating limit speed (VMO/MMO) and the
demonstrated flight diving speed (VDF/MDF), where the non-subscript “M”
refers to a Mach number limitation. MFC need not exceed the Mach number at
which an effective speed warning occurs.
stabilized approach. A landing approach in which the pilot establishes
maintains a constant angle glidepath towards a predetermined point on
landing runway. It is based on the pilot’s judgment of certain visual cues,
depends on the maintenance of a constant final descent airspeed
configuration.

and
the
and
and

stabilizer (airplane control surface). The fixed horizontal tail surface on an
airplane. The stabilizer is set on the airplane so it provides the correct amount of
stabilizing downward aerodynamic force when the aircraft is flying at its normal
cruise speed. The elevators are hinged to the trailing edge of the stabilizer.
stabilons (airplane control surface). Small wing-like horizontal surfaces mounted
on the aft fuselage of some airplanes to improve longitudinal stability. Stabilons
are installed on airplanes that have an exceptionally wide center of gravity range.

stable isotope. An isotope of an element that does not undergo radioactive
disintegration. An unstable isotope, or radioisotope, emits radioactive energy as
it decays.
stage length. The distance between landing points in airline operation.
stage of a compressor (turbine engines). One disk of rotor blades and the
following set of stator vanes in an axial-flow compressor.
stagger (airplane rigging). The relationship between the longitudinal location of
the two wings of a biplane. If the upper wing is further forward than the lower
wing, the airplane has positive stagger; but if the lower wing is ahead of the
upper wing, the airplane has negative stagger.
staggered timing (reciprocating engine ignition). A method of timing the dual
ignition of a reciprocating engine. When the timing is staggered, the spark plug
nearest the exhaust valve fires before the spark plug nearest the intake valve. In
some engines, the exhaust gases are not completely scavenged, and they dilute
the fuel-air charge in the cylinder. This diluted charge near the exhaust valve
burns more slowly than the undiluted charge near the intake valve, and it is
therefore ignited earlier.
stagger wires (airplane rigging component). High-strength steel wires that
connect diagonally fore and aft across the cabane struts of an biplane.
Adjustment of the length of the stagger wires determines the fore-and-aft
relationship of the upper wing to the lower wing.
staging/queuing (air traffic control). The placement, integration, and segregation
of departure aircraft in designated movement areas of an airport by departure fix,
EDCT, and/or restriction.
stagnation point (fluid dynamics). A location on a body in a stream of moving
fluid at which the fluid has stopped—it has no velocity. The stagnation point on
an airfoil is at the leading edge where the air splits, with some air passing over
the top of the airfoil and the rest passing below it.
stain (finishing material). A form of nonprotective finish used on wood to color
the wood without hiding the grain. After a piece of wood is stained, it is usually
covered with varnish to protect it.
stainless steel. An alloy of iron, chromium, and nickel that is resistant to rust and
corrosion. Stainless steel is more correctly called corrosion-resistant steel.

Neither the 200 series nor the 300 series of stainless steel can be hardened by
heat treatment, and the steel in both of these series is nonmagnetic. The 400
series of stainless steel which can be hardened by heat treatment and is magnetic
is used for knife blades and razor blades.
staking. A method of securing a part in a recess in a metal surface. For example,
a disk can be fastened in a counterbored hole by staking the edges of the hole.
The disk is put into the hole, and a pointed staking tool is held near the edge of
the hole and hit with a hammer. The staking tool forces metal from the edge of
the hole over the disk to prevent its from coming out of the hole.
stall (aerodynamic condition). An aerodynamic condition in which the angle of
attack, the angle at which the relative wind strikes the airfoil, becomes so steep
the air can no longer flow smoothly over the airfoil. When an airfoil stalls, it
stops producing lift.
stalled-rotor torque (electric motor characteristic). The amount of torque
produced by the rotor of an electric motor when it is fully energized with the
correct voltage, but the rotor is held so it cannot turn.
stall strip (airplane wing component). A small triangular metal strip installed
along the leading edge of an airplane wing near the root. Many airplane wings
begin to stall near the tip, in the area ahead of the ailerons. When this portion of
the wing stalls, the pilot no longer has good control of the aircraft. To allow
adequate control throughout the stall, the small stall strips force the roots of the
wing to stall before the tips. When the wing roots stall, the nose of the aircraft
drops, and the aircraft recovers from the stall with complete control throughout.
stall warning system (aircraft flight instrument). A system that warns the pilot
when the angle of attack of the wing reaches a point that will likely produce a
stall. Stall warning systems measure the angle of attack. Some systems use a
small air-operated vane on the leading edge of the wing to detect the high angle
of attack. Others use an angle of attack probe on the fuselage. A few of the
smaller airplanes have a reed-type horn in the wing that changes its sound as the
angle of attack changes.
Some stall warning systems turn on a light or sound a warning horn when the
angle of attack gets too near the angle that could cause a stall. Some of the more
elaborate systems, called stick shakers, vibrate the control column, and stick
pushers actually push the control column forward when a stall is approached.

stand-alone approach. An instrument approach that relies solely on the use of
RNAV equipment. If flown with GPS/WAAS-enabled certified equipment in
accordance with TSO-C145A or TSO-146A, installed in accordance with the
provisions of AC 20-130A or 138A, no conventional navigation equipment
alternate approach (VOR/ILS) requirements are necessary, as when flying with
TSO-C129 certified equipment.
stand-alone FAROS. A fully automated system that provides runway occupancy
status to pilots on final approach to indicate whether it may be unsafe to land.
The system is activated by localized or comprehensive sensors detecting aircraft
or ground vehicles occupying specific areas of the runway called activation
zones, which it monitors to determine the presence of vehicles. See also final
approach runway occupancy signal (FAROS).

(International Civil Aeronautics Organization) for relating all aircraft and engine
performance to a given reference. See standard atmospheric conditions.
standard empty weight (GAMA). (1) Weight of a standard airplane including

standard holding pattern (air traffic control). A holding pattern in which all turns
are made to the right.
standard instrument departure (SID). Also known as a departure procedure (DP),
a preplanned IFR ATC departure procedure printed for pilot/controller use to
provide obstacle clearance and a transition from the terminal area to the
appropriate enroute structure. SIDs are primarily developed and designed to
increase capacity of terminal airspace, effectively control the flow of traffic with
minimal communication to reduce pilot/controller workload, and reduce
environmental impact through noise abatement procedures. ATC clearance must
always be received prior to flying a SID.

patterns to move aircraft between gates and runways. ATC issues clearances
using these coded routes to reduce radio communication and eliminate taxi
instruction misinterpretation.

mountain waves, or lee waves.
standing waves (electrical transmission line). Stationary voltage waves existing
on an antenna or transmission line that are caused by two waves, identical in
amplitude and frequency, but traveling in opposite directions along the
conductor.
“Stand by” (air traffic control). A phrase used by ATC meaning that the
controller or pilot must pause for a few seconds, usually to attend to other duties
of a higher priority. It also means to wait, as in “stand by for clearance.” The
phrase “stand by” is neither an approval nor denial.
standpipe. A pipe protruding upward from the bottom of a tank, or reservoir, that
allows part of the tank to be used as a reserve, or standby, source of fluid. The
oil supply tanks for some aircraft engines have a standpipe in them. The main
engine-driven oil pump is supplied from the standpipe, and emergency oil to
feather the propeller is taken from the bottom of the tank. If an oil leak causes a
loss of all of the oil the engine pump can move, there is still enough oil left in
the tank to feather the propeller.

are used to fasten wires to a wooden post or wall, and to fasten sheets of paper
together.
staple (textile material). The average length of the fibers of a textile material.

reciprocating engine that can be coupled to the engine to turn it over fast enough
for it to start and run normally.
starter-generator. A combination electrical component installed on some small
gas turbine engines. The starter-generator acts as a motor to start the engine, and
after it is running, electrical relays change the circuitry inside the unit so it
functions as a generator.
starter solenoid (electrical component). An intermittent-duty solenoid that directs
the high current needed to operate an aircraft-engine starter.
starting torque (electric motor characteristic). The amount of torque produced by
an electric motor when the rotor first begins to turn. Series-wound motors have a
high starting torque, and shunt-wound motors have a low starting torque.
STAR transition. A published segment used to connect one or more en route
airway, jet route, or RNAV route to the basic STAR procedure. It is one of
several routes that bring traffic from different directions into one STAR.
AeroNav publishes STARs for airports with procedures authorized by the FAA,
included at the front of each Terminal Procedures Publication regional booklet.
start winding (induction motor winding). An auxiliary winding in parallel with
the run winding in the stator of a single-phase induction motor. The phase of the
current in the start winding is different from that in the run winding. When
current is flowing through both windings, a rotating magnetic field is produced
which causes the rotor to turn. As soon as the rotor reaches a predetermined
speed, a centrifugal switch opens the start winding, and the motor operates on
the run windings alone.
starved joint (composites). An adhesive joint which has been deprived of the
proper film thickness of adhesive due to insufficient adhesive spreading or by
the application of excessive pressure during the lamination process.
state aircraft. Aircraft used in military, customs and police service, in the
exclusive service of any government or its political subdivision including the
government of any state, territory, or possession of the United States or the

District of Columbia. However, this does not include any government-owned
aircraft engaged in carrying persons or property for commercial purposes.
state of charge (battery condition). The condition of a storage battery with regard
to the amount of charge in it. The state of charge of a lead-acid battery can be
determined by measuring the specific gravity of the electrolyte, but the state of
charge of a nickel-cadmium battery can be determined only by completely
discharging it and measuring the amount of charge put back into it.
state vector. A set of geographical data, used in navigation (such as GPS or
inertial navigation), describing exactly where an object is located in space, and
how it is moving; using the state vector, the object’s current and future position
can be determined. Usually it will contain seven pieces of data: the three position
coordinates (latitude, longitude, and altitude), three velocity values, and the time
at which these were valid.
static. Still, not moving.
static air pressure. The pressure of the ambient air surrounding the aircraft. Static
pressure does not take into consideration any air movement.
static air temperature. The temperature of the air when there is no movement.
static balance (aircraft control surface). A condition of balance of an aircraft
control surface in which the surface balances about its hinge line. Lead weights
are often installed in parts of the surface ahead of the hinge line to balance the
surface. Controls are statically balanced to prevent control-surface flutter.
static charge (electrical charge). The electrical charge on a body caused by an
accumulation of electrons on one part of the body and a deficiency of electrons
on another part. The part having the excess of electrons has a negative charge,
and the part with the deficiency of electrons has a positive charge.
static discharger. A device attached to an aircraft control surface to discharge
static electricity into the air. Static electricity builds up as air flows across the
surface. If it were not discharged, it could build up high enough to cause a spark
to jump between the surface and the main structure. Sparks of this type cause
radio interference.
Some static dischargers use carbon-impregnated cotton wicks to pick up the
static electricity and discharge it off the ends of the cotton fibers. Other

dischargers have needle-sharp points from which the static electricity is
discharged.

static electricity. Electrical pressure produced by an excess of electrons (a
negative charge) or a deficiency of electrons (a positive charge). Static charges
accumulate on an insulated surface because of friction, and remain in a still, or
static, condition until a conductive path is provided to an oppositely charged
surface, or to ground. When a path is provided, electrons flow and neutralize the
charge.
static friction. The force that is required to move one body relative to another
when they are at rest. It is also known as starting friction.
static instability (aerodynamics). The characteristic of an aircraft, that once
disturbed from straight and level flight will tend to move further from its original
condition.

systems of an aircraft that are caused by static electricity produced by air
flowing across an unbonded control surface, or by sparking of an electric motor.
static load. The load imposed on an aircraft structure by the weight of the aircraft
and its contents.
static longitudinal stability. The aerodynamic pitching moments required to
return the aircraft to the equilibrium angle of attack.
static port (aircraft instruments). A small hole, or port, in the skin of an aircraft
at a location where the airflow is not disturbed. The airspeed indicator, altimeter,
and vertical speed indicator get their reference static air pressure from this port.
Some aircraft pick up their static pressure from a combined pitot-static tube.

static pressure, Ps (fluid pressure). The pressure of a fluid that is still, or not
moving, measured perpendicular to the surface exposed to the fluid. Static
pressure and dynamic pressure, which is caused by the movement of the air,
make up the total pressure of a mass of air. Static air pressure relates to the
density of the air, and density is affected by both the altitude (pressure) and the
air temperature.
static pressure pickup (aircraft instrument system). The location on the surface of
an aircraft where the static air pressure used in the altimeter, airspeed indicator,
and the vertical speed indicator is picked up. Static pressure is often taken from
flush static ports on the sides of the fuselage or on the sides of the vertical tail
surface. In other installations, static pressure is picked up from ports in the side
of a combination pitot-static tube. Static pressure pickups must be located in an
area where there is no movement of air in a direction that could blow into the
static holes.
static radial engine. A type of reciprocating engine in which the cylinders are
arranged radially around a small crankcase. Static radial engines are different
from rotary radial engines in that their cylinders do not rotate with the propeller.
Static radial engines were at one time the most popular configuration of engine
used in airplanes, because of their low weight-to-power ratio. But they have so
much frontal area that they produce too much drag for modern high-speed
aircraft. Radial engines can have three, five, seven, or nine cylinders in one row.
Two or four rows of cylinders can be stacked together to make an engine with
14, 18, 28, or 36 cylinders.
static restrictions (air traffic control). Those restrictions that are usually not
subject to change, fixed, in place, and/or published.
static RPM (aircraft reciprocating engine operation). The number of revolutions
per minute an aircraft engine can produce when the aircraft is not moving. The
static RPM is lower than the RPM the engine develops in flight because of the
increased power made possible by forward movement ramming air into the
carburetor inlet.
static stability (aerodynamics). The characteristic of an aircraft that causes it to
try to return to straight and level flight after it has been disturbed from this
condition.

static stop (helicopter rotor). A device used to limit the blade or rotor flap at low
rpm or when the rotor is stopped.
static system (flight instrument system). The system that provides static air
pressure to the airspeed indicator, altimeter, and vertical speed indicator from the
static ports.
static test (structural test). A type of test given to such mechanisms as airplane
structures. Hydraulic cylinders or sandbags apply forces to simulate loads that
could possibly be encountered in flight, and the amount the structure deflects is
measured. Some static testing is carried to destruction—the structure is loaded
until something breaks. Testing to destruction identifies the weakest point in the
structure.
static thrust (gas turbine engines). The amount of thrust produced by a gas
turbine engine when the engine is not moving through the air.
static wick. A device used to bleed an accumulated static electrical charge off an
aircraft control surface and discharge it into the air. The wick is made of
graphite-impregnated cotton fibers, enclosed in a plastic tube. One end of the
wick is electrically connected to the trailing edge of a control surface, and the
other end of the fibers are spread out of the end of the tube so the hundreds of
fiber ends stick out into the air. As the airplane flies through the air, static
electricity builds up on the control surfaces, travels through the static wicks, and
discharges into the air from the tips of the cotton fibers.
station. A location on an aircraft identified by a number designating its distance
in inches from the datum.
stationary front (meteorology). A front that is moving at a speed of less than 5
knots.

and the zero radial of a VOR at the time the VOR was last site checked.
station pressure (meteorology). The actual barometric (atmospheric) pressure

measured at the observing station.
stator (electrical machine component). The part of an electric motor or generator
that produces the stationary, or nonmoving, electromagnetic field. In a directcurrent alternator, such as is used on most light airplanes, the stator windings are
the coils of heavy copper wire in which the output current is produced.
stator (gas turbine engine component). The stationary portion of an axial-flow
compressor in a gas turbine engine. A stage of stator vanes is located between
each stage of rotor blades. Stator vanes slow the airflow and increase its
pressure.
statute mile. A unit of linear measurement in the English system. One statute
mile is equal to 5,280 feet, or 1.609 kilometers.
stay (structural member). A structural member in a truss that is loaded in tension
only. Stays are usually made of steel wire, and their length is adjusted by
turnbuckles.
STC (Supplemental Type Certificate). An approval issued by the FAA for a
modification to a type-certificated airframe, engine, or component. More than
one STC can be issued for the same basic alteration, but each holder must prove
to the FAA that his alteration meets all of the requirements of the original type
certificate.
steady-state condition (electrical circuit condition). The condition of an electrical
circuit that exists when all of the circuit values are constant. When some circuits
are first energized, voltage or current transients cause conditions that are not
normal. The steady-state conditions can be measured only after all of these
transient conditions have stabilized.
steady-state flight. A condition when an aircraft is in straight-and-level,
unaccelerated flight, and all forces are in balance.
steam. Water that has been changed into its vapor state by heating it. Steam is
invisible, but the cloud of tiny droplets of water that rises above boiling water is
often called steam.
steam cooling. A method of liquid cooling a reciprocating engine in which the
coolant, normally water, is allowed to absorb enough heat that it boils, or
changes into steam. The steam gives up this heat when it condenses back into a
liquid.

steam fog (meteorology). Fog formed when cold air moves over relatively warm
water or wet ground.
steatite. A ceramic insulating material used in making insulators for highvoltage, high-frequency radio transmitters. Steatite is mainly a silicate of
magnesium.
steel. An alloy of iron that usually contains between 0.1% and 1.5% carbon with
other elements. Iron is melted in a furnace, and air or oxygen is blown through it
to combine with and get rid of the excess carbon. After sufficient carbon has
been removed, the correct amounts of such alloying elements as manganese,
molybdenum, chromium, nickel, vanadium, and tungsten are added. The steel is
poured from the furnace into ingots, which are rolled or forged into the desired
shape or form.
steel wool. A mat of fine threads of steel. Steel wool is used as an abrasive to
remove rust or to clean a surface.
steep spiral (flight maneuver). A constant gliding turn, during which a constant
radius around a point on the ground is maintained similar to the maneuver, turns
around a point.
steep turns (flight maneuver). In instrument flight, anything greater than standard
rate; in visual flight, anything greater than a 45° bank.
steering bars. Bars located just aft of the nosewheel and mounted on each side of
the aircraft that move forward and back when the pilot applies foot pressure.
Pushing either one of the steering bars causes the steering lines to pull down on
the corresponding surface of the wing’s trailing edge, which banks the PPC into
a turn.
stellite. A nonferrous alloy of cobalt, chromium, and tungsten. Stellite is hard,
wear- and corrosion-resistant, and does not soften until its temperature is
extremely high. Stellite is welded to the face of many reciprocating engine
exhaust valves that operate at very high temperatures.
stem. The part of a multiple-choice test item consisting of the question,
statement, or problem.
step (seaplane hull design). A break in the bottom of the hull of a flying boat or
seaplane float. When a seaplane is taking off, it is rocked back and forth in the

water as its speed increases until the float rides high enough for air to pass
between the water and the step. Getting a seaplane up on the step decreases the
friction of the water against the float.
step descent (balloon operation). A method of allowing a balloon to lower
toward the ground by reducing the altitude, leveling-off, and repeating the step,
to lower the balloon in increments rather than one continuous motion.
stepdown fix (air traffic control). (1) Permits additional descent within a segment
of an IAP by identifying a point at which an obstacle has been safely overflown.
(2) A fix permitting additional descent within a segment of an instrument
approach procedure by identifying a point at which a controlling obstacle has
been safely overflown.
step-down transformer (electrical transformer). A type of electrical transformer
with more turns in the primary winding than in the secondary. The secondary
voltage of a step-down transformer is lower than the primary voltage, but the
secondary current is greater than the primary current.
step leader (meteorology). A path of ionized air which extends downward from a
thundercloud during the initial stages of atmospheric breakdown during a
lightning strike.
stepped solvents (finishing material component). Solvents in a finishing material
that have different rates of evaporation. A finishing material thinned with
stepped solvents dries evenly and slowly, as the solvents evaporate out over a
long period of time.
stepping motor. A precision electric motor whose output shaft position is
changed in steps by pulses from the control device. Stepping motors can make
high-torque changes in small angular increments to their output shaft.
stepping relay. A type of relay-operated multipole electrical switch. A relay
moves the wiper, or selector, of the switch one step at a time, as pulses of
electrical energy are sent into the relay coil. Stepping relays are used in rotarydial telephone systems.
step position (seaplane operation). The attitude of the seaplane when the entire
weight of the aircraft is supported by hydrodynamic and aerodynamic lift, as it is
during high-speed taxi or just prior to takeoff. This position produces the least
amount of water drag. Also called the planing position, or being on the step.

step stud, stepped stud. A type of stud used to replace a stud that has stripped the
threads in a cast housing. A stud is a type of threaded fastener used to fasten a
component to a casting; for example, to fasten the cylinders of an aircraft engine
to the crankcase. One end of the stud has coarse threads that screw into the soft
metal of the casting. The other end has fine threads to accept a nut.
If the threads in the soft casting are stripped, the threads can be drilled out and
tapped for a larger stud, and a stepped stud can be used. The coarse threads on
the stepped stud are usually one bolt size larger than the fine threads.

step taxi (float plane operation). To taxi a float plane at full power or high RPM.
step turn (float plane operation). A maneuver used to put a float plane in a
planing configuration prior to entering an active sea lane for takeoff.
step-up coil (electrical component). A transformer that has more turns in its
secondary winding than in its primary winding. The secondary voltage will be
greater than the primary voltage by the same ratio as that between the turns in
the windings. The secondary current will be less than the primary current by the
inverse of this ratio.
step-up transformer (electrical transformer). A type of electrical transformer with
more turns in the secondary winding than in the primary. The secondary voltage
of a step-up transformer is higher than the primary voltage, but the secondary
current is less than the primary current.

identified by a coded name; e.g., ALPHA 2. These routes minimize flight plan
handling and communications.
sterile cockpit (flight operation). FAA regulations specifically prohibiting crew
member to perform non-essential duties or activities while the aircraft is
involved in taxi, takeoff, landing, and all other flight operations conducted below
10,000 feet MSL, except cruise flight.

airplane is approaching the maximum operating speed.
stick pusher. A device that applies an abrupt and large forward force on the
control column when the airplane is nearing an angle of attack at which a stall
could occur.
stick shaker. An artificial stall warning device that vibrates the control column.
stiffener (sheet metal structural component). A piece of formed sheet metal or
extrusion riveted to a larger piece of thin sheet metal to give it rigidity and
stiffness. Some types of aircraft sheet metal structure have large areas of thin
sheet metal that vibrate and cause noise and weaken the metal. To prevent this
metal from vibrating, a stiffener in the shape of a hat section, a channel, or an
angle is riveted across the sheet. This stiffens it enough to stop the vibration.
stimulants (physiology). Drugs that excite the central nervous system to produce
an increase in alertness and activity.
Stoddard solvent. A petroleum product, similar to naphtha, used as a solvent and
a cleaning fluid.
stoichiometric mixture (heat engine fuel-air mixture). The ratio of the mixture of
fuel and air that, when burned in a heat engine, leaves no uncombined oxygen
nor free carbon. A stoichiometric mixture of gasoline and air contains one pound
of gasoline and 15 pounds of air.
STOL (Short TakeOff and Landing). STOL performance of an aircraft is the
ability of the aircraft to take off and clear a 50-foot obstruction in a distance of
1,500 feet from the beginning the takeoff run. It must also be able to stop within
1,500 feet after crossing over a 50-foot obstacle on landing.
“Stop altitude squawk” (air traffic control). A phrase used by ATC to inform a
pilot to turn off the automatic altitude reporting feature of his transponder. This
phrase is used when the verbally reported altitude varies 300 feet or more from
the automatic altitude report.
stop and go landing (flight operation). A procedure in which an aircraft lands,
makes a complete stop on the runway and then commences a takeoff from that
point.

stop countersink (sheet metal tool). A cutting tool used to cut the chamfered
holes into which flush rivet heads fit. The cutter, which is driven by a shaft
mounted in a handheld drill motor, fits through a bushing in the body of the stop
unit and extends out beyond a fiber collar on the end of the body. The body is
made in two parts threaded together to allow the length of the body to be
adjusted. The body length determines the amount the cutter protrudes, and this,
in turn, controls the depth of the hole made by the cutter. A fiber collar prevents
the stop scratching the soft metal being countersunk.
stop drilling (method of crack arresting). A method of stopping the growth of a
crack in a piece of metal by drilling a small hole at the end of the crack. A crack
in a piece of metal subject to vibration will continue to grow because of the
stresses concentrated at its end in an extremely small area. Very little force
acting on this tiny area will tear the metal. If a small hole is drilled at the end of
the crack, the forces, instead of being concentrated at the end of the crack,
spread out around the circumference of the hole, and much more force is needed
to tear the metal.
stop nut. See elastic stop nut.
stopover flight plan (air traffic control). A flight plan format which permits in a
single submission, the filing of a sequence of flight plans through interim fullstop destinations to a final destination.
“stop squawk (mode or code)” (air traffic control). Used by ATC to tell the pilot
to turn specified functions of the aircraft transponder off.

the runway and centered upon the extended centerline of the runway, able to
support the airplane during an aborted takeoff, without causing structural
damage to the airplane, and designated by the airport authorities for use in
decelerating the airplane during an aborted takeoff.”

discharged storage battery can be recharged by placing it across a source of
direct current until the chemical composition of the plates and the electrolyte
change to their charged condition.

storm-detection radar (radar meteorology). A weather radar designed to detect
hydrometeors of precipitation size. Storm-detection radar is used primarily to
detect storms containing large drops of water or hailstones, as opposed to clouds
and light precipitation of small drop size.
Stormscope (weather detection indicator). The registered trade name of an
instrument that detects severe weather conditions by measuring the amount and
intensity of static electrical discharges within the storm.
STOVL (Short TakeOff and Vertical Landing). STOVL performance of an
aircraft is the ability of the aircraft to take off and clear a 50-foot obstruction in a

piece of material or surface for straightness, or used to draw straight lines. A
straightedge is similar to a ruler, except a straightedge does not have graduations
marked on it.
straight-in IFR approach (air traffic control). An instrument approach in which
the final approach is begun without first executing a procedure turn. A straightin approach is not necessarily completed with a straight-in landing, nor is it
made to straight-in landing minimums.

pattern by intercepting the extended runway center line without executing any
other portion of the traffic pattern.
structural. A type of handheld hammer used for forming sheet metal. One end of
the head is round and has a flat face. The other end is wedge-shaped, with the
apex (peak) of the wedge parallel to the handle. A cross-peen hammer is much
like a straight-peen hammer except the wedge on its head is perpendicular to the
handle.
straight-polarity arc welding. DC electric arc welding in which the electrode is
negative with respect to the work.

straight-run gasoline (petroleum product). Gasoline refined from crude oil
without the addition of any of the additives used in some of the other methods of
refining.
straight-through combustor (turbine engine component). A combustor in a gas
turbine engine through which the air from the compressor to the turbine flows in
an essentially straight line.
strain. A deformation, or physical change, in a material caused by a stress.
According to Hooke’s law, the strain in a material, the amount it stretches or
compresses, is directly proportional to the stress, until the elastic limit of the
material is reached. Spring scales and certain types of torque wrenches work on
the principle that strain is proportional to stress.
strain gage. A device attached to the surface of a piece of equipment to measure
the amount of strain acting on the surface. A strain gage is a piece of extremely
fine wire bonded (glued) to the surface, with the length of the wire parallel to
direction of the strain to be measured. When the surface is stressed, it is also
strained (deformed), and it either stretches or compresses. Since the strain gage
is bonded to the surface, it also stretches or compresses. The resistance of the
strain gage is measured with a precision bridge-type instrument, and the
resistance change caused by the wire stretching or compressing is measured.
Strain gages are calibrated so the change in resistance indicates the amount of
strain acting on the surface.
strain hardening (metallurgy). A method of hardening metals that cannot be
hardened by heat treatment. Copper, some aluminum alloys, and low-carbon
steel cannot be hardened by heat treatment, but they can be hammered, rolled,
pulled, or bent to change their grain structure enough that they become hard.
strake (helicopter aerodynamics). A flat metal strip attached lengthwise to the
left-hand side of the tail boom of a helicopter, slightly above the center of the
boom. Downwash air from the main rotor passes over the tail boom in a near
vertical direction. As it flows over the boom, according to the Coanda effect, it
speeds up and its pressure decreases. The air flowing over the left side of the
boom strikes the strake and is made turbulent and slower than the air on the right
side. The pressure differential across the tail boom moves it to the right to
correct for torque. See Coanda effect.

strake (high-speed aerodynamics). A slender forward extension of the inboard
area of the wing of a high-speed aircraft. Strakes increase lift during high angleof-attack maneuvers by allowing the flow to separate along its leading edge and
form strong leading-edge vortices. The swirling motion in these vortices create a
low pressure area on the upper surface of the strake and produce a lift force
which increases as the angle of attack increases.
stranded wire (electrical conductor). An electrical conductor made up of a
number of small wires. These wires are either twisted together or braided and are
usually enclosed in an insulating material. A stranded wire is often called a
cable.
strapdown system. An inertial navigation system, INS, in which the
accelerometers and gyros are permanently “strapped down” or aligned with the
three axes of the aircraft.

in layers. Stratus clouds, stratocumulus, and nimbostratus clouds are all
stratiform clouds.
stratocumulus (meteorology). Low clouds that are predominantly stratiform in
nature. Stratocumulus clouds are gray with some dark parts and often with white
patches.
stratopause (meteorology). The dividing line between the stratosphere and
mesosphere at an altitude of approximately 160,000 feet.
stratosphere. The upper part of earth’s atmosphere. The stratosphere extends
upward from the tropopause, which is about seven miles (11 kilometers) above
the surface of the earth, to an altitude of about 22 miles (35 kilometers). The
temperature of the air in the stratosphere remains constant at −56.5°C (−69.7°F),
and since there is no water vapor in the stratosphere, there are no clouds, nor any
of the weather conditions that exist at the lower altitudes.
stratus (meteorology). A low, gray cloud layer or sheet with a fairly uniform
base. Stratus clouds sometimes appear in ragged patches. They seldom produce
precipitation but may produce drizzle or snow grains.

streamlined body. A body whose shape is such that fluid moving over it flows in
smooth lines with no turbulence. A fish is an excellent example of a streamlined

body. The fish can move through the water with a minimum of opposition. Fluid
flowing around a flat plate or circular object has a turbulent area behind it. This
turbulence causes drag. There is a minimum area of turbulence in the flow of
fluid behind a streamlined body.
streamline flow. The flow of a fluid in which there is no turbulence. All particles
of the fluid move in continuous smooth lines.

that try to break it.
stress. A force within an object that tries to prevent any outside force changing
its shape.
stress corrosion. A form of intergranular corrosion that forms in metals that are
subject to a continuous tensile stress. The tensile stress separates the metal along
the internal grain boundaries, and the corrosion acts at the apex of the cracks that
form.
stress crack (transparent plastics). External or internal cracks in a plastic caused
by tensile stresses which are frequently accelerated by the environment to which
the plastic is exposed.
stressed-skin structure. A type of aircraft structure that has a minimum of
internal structure and carries all, or most, of the stresses in its outside skin. An
egg shell is a perfect example of a natural stressed-skin. All of the stresses acting
on an egg are carried in its shell.
stress management (psychology). The personal analysis of the kinds of stress
experienced while flying, the application of appropriate stress assessment tools,
and other coping mechanisms.
stress relieve (steel heat treatment). A type of heat treatment of steel. When steel
parts are forged, machined, or welded, stresses are often locked in them that
cause the parts to warp or break. These stresses can be relieved by heating the
part until it is red-hot and then allowing it to cool slowly in still air to room
temperature. This type of stress relieving is called normalizing.
stress riser. A location on a structure where the cross-sectional area of the part
changes drastically. Stresses concentrated at such locations are likely to cause

failure. A scratch, gouge, or tool mark in the surface of a highly stressed part can
change the area enough to concentrate the stresses, and it becomes a stress riser.
stringer (aircraft structure). A part of an aircraft fuselage structure used to give
the fuselage its shape and, in some types of structure, to provide a small portion
of the fuselage strength. Formers give the fuselage its cross-sectional shape, and
stringers, which are channels or angles of sheet metal or metal extrusions, fill in
the shape between the formers. Stringers in a semimonocoque fuselage are
covered with sheet metal, and in a truss-type fuselage, with fabric.
strobe. A high-intensity white flashing light. Strobe lights are located on aircraft
wingtips to increase aircraft visibility in low-light conditions.
stroboscope. A special light that flashes with a brilliant, short-duration flash. A
variable-frequency oscillator controls the stroboscope so it flashes at any
required interval. Stroboscopes are used to study the motion of rotating or
vibrating bodies. The stroboscope is shone on the object, and the frequency of
the flashes is adjusted until the object appears to stand still or move in slow
motion.
stroboscopic tachometer. A device used to measure rotational speed by the use
of a stroboscopic light. A brilliant light which flashes at a controlled rate is
shone on the rotating object. When the light is adjusted to flash at the same rate
the object is rotating, the object appears to stand still. The flash rate of the light
is calibrated in terms of revolutions per minute (RPM).

member within the structure, or of the structure itself. Structural failure is
initiated when the material is stressed beyond its ultimate load, thus causing
fracture or permanent deformation.
structural icing. The accumulation of ice on the exterior of an aircraft.

strut, jury strut, compression strut.
stub antenna (radio antenna). A short, wide UHF blade antenna used for DME
and ATC transponders.

resulting from abnormal vertical gradients of temperature and/or water vapor.
subscript. A number or letter written to the right of, and partially below, an
abbreviation or a number. In gas turbine engine operation, the symbol PAm

that this pressure is ambient pressure. The chemical formula for water is H2O.
The subscript “2” indicates that two atoms of hydrogen unite with one atom of
oxygen to form one molecule of water.
subsidence (meteorology). A descending motion of the air in the atmosphere

this particular material is not available, another material may be used in its place.
The material used in place of the one specified is a substitute material.
substitute route (air traffic control). A route assigned to pilots when any part of
an airway or route is unusable because of NAVAID status. These routes consist

suction. A term commonly used for a negative pressure, or a pressure below
atmospheric pressure. The terms suction and vacuum are both used to mean a
negative pressure.
suction gage. The instrument that monitors the negative pressure produced by a

vacuum pump. The suction gage is often marked to indicate the normal
operating range for the pneumatic flight instruments.
suction relief valve (pneumatic system component). A component that holds a
constant and steady suction, a pressure lower than that of the atmosphere, on a
system. Some gyroscopic instruments used in an aircraft are operated by air
pulled into the instrument case by a suction produced by an engine-driven
vacuum pump.
A suction relief valve in the line between the pump and the instrument case has
a spring-loaded poppet that remains closed until the pressure becomes low
enough to allow outside air pressure to force the poppet off its seat, then outside
air is taken into the pump through the valve, rather than through the instrument
case. This air entering the system holds the pressure inside the instrument case at
the value for which the suction relief valve is set.
suction vortex (meteorology). A small but very intense vortex within a tornado
circulation.
sudden stoppage (engine operating condition). A condition likely to cause
internal damage to an aircraft engine. An engine is said to have a sudden
stoppage if it comes to a complete stop within one revolution of the crankshaft.
sulfating (battery condition). A condition in a lead-acid storage battery in which
both the positive and negative plates are covered with a hard deposit of lead
sulfate. When a lead-acid battery discharges, the active material on both its
plates changes into lead sulfate, which can be removed by recharging the battery.
But if the battery is allowed to stand in a discharged state for a long period of
time, the sulfate hardens and is difficult, if not impossible, to remove by normal
recharging.
sulfur. A pale yellow, nonmetallic chemical element. Sulfur’s symbol is S, its
atomic number is 16, and its atomic weight is 32.064. Sulfur, also spelled

cover assigned to a layer is equal to the summation of the cover of the lowest

layer, plus the additional coverage at all successively higher layers, up to and
including the layer in question. No layer can be assigned a sky cover less than a
lower layer, and no sky cover can be greater than 1.0 (10/10).

forms in a tree during the latter part of the growing season, the summer of the
year.
sump (aircraft engine component). A low point in an aircraft engine in which

removable sump attached to the bottom of the crankcase of a reciprocating
engine is often called an oil pan.
sump (fuel tank component). A low point in an aircraft fuel tank in which water
and other contaminants collect and are held until they can be drained out.
sump jar (aircraft battery installation component). A small jar located in the vent
line of an aircraft battery box. The sump jar used in a lead-acid battery
installation contains a sponge saturated with a solution of bicarbonate of soda
and water. Acid fumes from the battery pass through the sump jar where they are
neutralized to prevent their causing corrosion in the aircraft structure. The sump
jar in a nickel-cadmium battery installation contains a boric acid solution to
neutralize the alkaline fumes from this battery.

the Nautical Almanac, converted to local standard time for the locality
concerned. Within Alaska, the end of evening civil twilight and the beginning of

winds, large hail, and/or tornadoes.
supercharged engine. A reciprocating engine that uses an air compressor to

increase the pressure of the air before it enters the engine cylinders.
supercharger (reciprocating engine component). An air pump used to increase
the pressure of the air taken into the cylinders of a reciprocating engine. The
amount of power a reciprocating engine can develop is determined by the mass,
or weight, of the fuel-air mixture taken into the cylinders. By compressing the
air before it enters the cylinders, a greater mass of air can be used, and more
power can be developed by the engine. Superchargers can be gear-driven from
the engine, or they can be driven by a turbine spun by exhaust gases.
Superchargers driven by exhaust gases are called turbochargers or
turbosuperchargers.
superconductivity. A condition of certain chemical elements (niobium, tantalum,
vanadium, tin, and others) when they are held at a temperature near absolute
zero. At this low temperature, these metals lose almost all their electrical
resistance and become strongly diamagnetic. They try to orient themselves
across a magnetic field, rather than aligning with the field.
supercooled water. Water in its liquid form at a temperature well below its
natural freezing temperature. When supercooled water is disturbed, it
immediately freezes.
supercritical airfoil (aerodynamics). An airfoil section that allows an airplane to
cruise efficiently at a speed very near Mach one (the speed of sound). The center
portion of the airfoil is nearly flat, and there is a distinct downward curve, or
cusp, near the trailing edge. The lower side of the forward part of the airfoil is
more curved than the upper side.

superheat (refrigeration system). Heat energy added to a refrigerant after it
changes from its liquid state into a vapor. The thermal expansion valve in a
refrigeration system meters just enough liquid refrigerant into the evaporator for
all of it to be changed from droplets of liquid into a vapor by the time it reaches
the end of the evaporator coils. If all of the refrigerant vaporizes before it
reaches the end of the coils, any additional heat raises its temperature. This
additional heat is called superheat.

superheated water. Water that has been heated to a temperature above that at
which it normally changes its state from liquid into steam. Water may be
superheated by holding it under pressure. More heat energy must be added to it
before its molecules move fast enough to leave the surface of the liquid and
become steam.
superheterodyne radio receiver circuit. The type of circuit used in most modern
radio receivers. A radio-frequency signal is received, amplified, and mixed with
a signal produced inside the radio by a local oscillator. The frequency of the
oscillator signal is always a fixed amount different from the radio-frequency
signals being received.
When the two signals are mixed, two more signals are produced. The
frequency of one is the sum of the other two, and the frequency of the other is
the difference between them. The signal whose frequency is the difference is
called an intermediate frequency, an IF. The IF is amplified and changed into an
audio-frequency voltage that duplicates the AF used to modulate the radiofrequency signal in the transmitter.

moored balloons to allow operations in relatively strong wind. In gas ballooning,
a sealed envelope in which the internal envelope pressure exceeds that of a
nonsealed envelope.
superrefraction (radar technology). More than normal bending of a radar beam
resulting from abnormal vertical gradients of temperature and/or water vapor.
supersaturated solution. A solution in which a solid is dissolved in a liquid until
the liquid will hold no more. A supersaturated solution of salt and water has
some salt crystals in the liquid. The amount of crystals depends upon the
temperature of the solution. As the temperature decreases, more crystals
precipitate out of the solution.
supersede. To replace, or take the place of, something. When a manufacturer
issues a revision to an instruction manual, the revised manual supersedes the

original one. If there is a difference in the instructions in the two manuals, the
instructions in the latest (the superseding) manual, are to be followed.

speed greater than the speed of sound.
supersonic flight. Flight at an airspeed in which all air flowing over the aircraft
is moving at a speed greater than the speed of sound.

group of aircraft that share similar scheduling characteristics. Super stream class
categories are typically based on engine type (jet or prop), destination airport,
and meter fix.
superstructure. The framework of formers and stringers attached to the main
truss of a truss-type aircraft fuselage. The superstructure gives the fuselage its
shape, but it is not a main strength-carrying part of the fuselage.

operations; or (4) a turbojet powered airplane with 1 or more but less than 31
passenger seats, excluding crewmember seats, that is also used in domestic or
flag operations and that is so listed in the operations specifications as required
for those operations.
In addition, a supplemental operation must be (1) an operation for which the
departure time, departure location, and arrival location are specifically
negotiated with the customer or the customer’s representative; (2) an all-cargo
operation; or (3) a passenger-carrying public charter operation conducted under
14 CFR Part 380.
supplemental pilot (unmanned aircraft). A pilot assigned unmanned aircraft
(UA) flight duties to augment the pilot in command. It is common in this

situation to have both an internal and an external UA pilot, and the supplemental
pilot can assume either of these positions. The supplemental pilot may also
assume duties of the PIC provided he or she meets the qualifications.
supplemental type certificate (STC). An approval issued by the FAA for a
modification to a type certificated airframe, engine, or component. More than

lubricating oil. Surface roughness is measured in microinches rms (min rms).
surface tape (aircraft fabric material). Strips of aircraft fabric that are doped over
all seams and all places where the fabric is stitched to the aircraft structure and
over wing leading edges where abrasive wear occurs. The edges of surface tape
are pinked, or notched, to keep them from raveling before the dope is applied.
surface tension. The cohesive force that causes molecules of a liquid to hold
themselves together. Surface tension tries to keep the area of the surface of the
liquid as small as possible. It is surface tension that causes a soap bubble to be

shaped like a sphere, since a sphere has the smallest surface area possible for its
volume.
surface visibility (meteorology). Visibility observed from eye-level above the
ground.
surfactant (fuel system contaminant). A surface active agent, or partially soluble
contaminant which is a by-product of fuel processing or of fuel additives.

hose by forcing the material of the fitting into the hose. Swaged fittings are also
installed on rigid fluid lines used in high-pressure hydraulic and pneumatic
systems.
swaged terminal (control cable terminal). A terminal pressed onto a steel control
cable. A swaged terminal is made in the form of a cylinder into which the steel
cable is slipped. This steel cylinder is then swaged (hammered into) the cable

with special swaging dies. The swaging dies compress the cylinder, and as the
inside of the hole becomes smaller than the outside of the cable, the metal of the
terminal is pressed around the wires of the cable. A properly swaged terminal
develops the full strength of the steel cable.
SWAP (severe weather avoidance plan) (air traffic control). An approved plan to
minimize the effect of severe weather on traffic flows in impacted terminal
and/or ARTCC areas. SWAP is normally implemented to provide the least
disruption to the air traffic control system when flight through portions of
airspace is difficult or impossible due to severe weather.
swash plate. The component in a helicopter control system that consists basically
of two bearing races with ball bearings between them. The lower, or nonrotating,
race is tilted by the cyclic control, and the upper, or rotating, race has arms
which connect to the control horns on the rotor blades. Movement of the cyclic
pitch control is transmitted to the rotating blades through the swash plate.
Movement of the collective pitch control raises or lowers the entire swash plate
assembly to change the pitch of all of the blades at the same time.
sweat soldering. A method of soldering two pieces of sheet metal together. Both
surfaces that form the seam are tinned (covered with a thin coating of solder),
and the joint is assembled. The entire assembly is put into an oven and heated
enough to melt the solder in the joint and produce a tight, uniform seal.
swell (sea condition). Waves that continue after the generating wind has ceased
or changed direction. Swells also are generated by ships and boats in the form of
wakes, and sometimes by underwater disturbances such as volcanoes or
earthquakes. These waves have a uniform and orderly appearance characterized
by smooth, rounded, regularly spaced wave crests. Once set in motion, swells
tend to maintain their original direction for as long as they continue in deep
water, regardless of wind direction, and may be moving into or across the local
wind.
swell velocity (sea condition). The velocity with which the swell advances with
relation to a fixed reference point, measured in knots. There is little movement
of water in the horizontal direction. Each water particle transmits energy to its
neighbor, resulting primarily in a vertical motion, similar to the motion observed

electrical circuit or to select paths through the circuit.
switching diode (electronic component). A type of semiconductor diode whose
resistance varies with the voltage across it. A switching diode acts as an open
switch when the voltage across it is low, but when the voltage rises to a certain
value, its resistance decreases, and the diode conducts, acting as a closed switch.

visual codes such as words, gestures, and facial expressions which are formed
into sentences, paragraphs, lectures, or chapters to compose and transmit a
message that means something to the receiver of the information.
symbols/symbolization (in teaching/learning process). See word/symbol
confusion.
symmetrical airfoil. An airfoil that has the same shape on both sides of its center
line. A symmetrical airfoil has a very small change in the location of its center of
pressure as its angle of attack changes. For this reason, symmetrical airfoils are
often used for helicopter rotors.

symmetrical laminate (composites). A composite laminate in which the ply
orientation is symmetrical about the laminate midplane.
symmetry check (rigging check). A dimensional check of an airframe to
determine that the wings and tail are symmetrical about the longitudinal axis.
synchro (remote indicating device). A device used to transmit indications of
angular movement or position from one location to another. See Autosyn
system.
synchronous motor (electric motor). An alternating current motor similar to an
induction motor, except the rotor is either a permanent magnet or an
electromagnet excited by an external source of direct current. The rotor of a
synchronous motor turns at a speed directly related to the frequency of the
alternating current used to excite its stator.
synchronous speed (induction motor). The speed of an induction motor at which
the rotor follows the rotating field in the stator. The synchronous speed, in
revolutions per minute, is found by dividing the frequency of the AC, in hertz,
by the number of poles in the stator. Then multiplying this answer by 120. A
four-pole induction motor, operating on 60-hertz AC, has a synchronous speed
of 1,800 RPM.
synchrophasing (propeller operation). A method of synchronizing the propellers
of a multiengine aircraft. The engines all turn at the same RPM, and the
propellers rotate in such a way that a master blade on each propeller keeps the
same relative position in its rotation as the master blade on each of the other
propellers.
synchroscope (aircraft instrument). A powerplant instrument used on
multiengine aircraft to detect and display the difference in rotational speed of the
various engines. One popular type of synchroscope has a small propeller on the
face of the instrument. The propeller rotates at a speed and in a direction
determined by the difference in RPM of the master engine and the other engine.
When the propeller on the instrument face is not rotating, the two engines are
turning at exactly the same speed.
synchro system (remote indicating system). A type of remote indicating system
that uses synchro motors in the transmitter and the indicator. These synchro
motors have a three-phase stator and a single-phase rotor. The stators and rotors

of the transmitter and indicator are connected in parallel, and alternating current
is used to excite the rotors.
The AC exciting the rotor induces a voltage in the three phases of the
transmitter stator, and since the two stators are connected in parallel, the
magnetic fields in the indicator are the same as those in the transmitter. The
magnetic fields in the indicator stator pull its rotor around so it assumes the same
position as the rotor in the transmitter. An Autosyn system is a form of synchro
system. See Autosyn system.

(changing) of a mineral-, animal-, or vegetable-oil base. Synthetic oils have
appropriate additives that give them such characteristics as low volatility, low
pour point, high viscosity index, good lubricating qualities, low coke and lacquer
formation, and low foaming.
Synthetic oils are superior to natural mineral oils because they resist oxidation
better, and they are able to be used over a wider range of operating temperatures.
Synthetic oils are used in almost all gas turbine engines and are used to some
extent in reciprocating engines.
synthetic vision (electronic display). The computer-generated image of the
external scene topography from the perspective of the flight deck that is derived
from aircraft attitude, high-precision navigation solution, and a database of
terrain, obstacles and relevant cultural features.

to display a synthetic vision depiction of the external scene topography to the
flight crew. Synthetic vision creates an image relative to terrain and airport
drawing from and within the limits of the navigation source capabilities
(position, altitude, heading, track, and the database limitations). The application
of synthetic vision systems is through a primary flight display from the
perspective of the flight deck (egocentric), or through a secondary flight display
from the perspective correlating to outside the aircraft (exocentric). The elements
of an installed SVS are as follows:
1. Display (includes interface and installation).
2. System interface.
3. Terrain and obstacle database.

4. Position source.
5. Altitude source.
6. Attitude source.
7. Heading and track source.
See also synthetic vision.
system pressure regulator (hydraulic power system component). A type of
hydraulic system-pressure control valve. When the system pressure is low, as it
is when some unit is being actuated, the output of the constant-delivery pump is
directed into the system. When the actuation is completed and the pressure
builds up to a specified kick-out pressure, the pressure regulator shifts. A check
valve seals the system off and the pressure is maintained by the accumulator.
The pump is unloaded and its output is directed back into the reservoir with very
little opposition. The pump output pressure drops, but the volume of flow
remains the same. When the system pressure drops to the specified kick-in
pressure, the regulator again shifts and directs fluid into the system. Spool-type
and balanced-pressure-type system pressure regulators are completely automatic
in their operation and require no attention on the part of the flight crew. A
system pressure regulator is also called an unloading valve.
system strategic navigation. Military activity accomplished by navigating along
a preplanned route using internal aircraft systems to maintain a desired track.
This activity normally requires a lateral route width of 10 NM and altitude range
of 1,000 feet to 6,000 feet AGL with some route segments that permit terrain
following.
system-wide information management (SWIM). An advanced technology
program designed to enable and promote greater sharing of Air Traffic
Management (ATM) system information, such as airport operational status,
weather information, flight data, status of special use airspace, and National
Airspace System (NAS) restrictions. SWIM supports current and future NAS
programs by providing flexible and secure information management architecture
for sharing NAS information.

flight condition. See antiservo tab, balance tab, servo tab, spring tab, trim tab.
TACAN (electronic navigation system). An electronic navigation system,
operating in the ultrahigh frequency (UHF) range. The name TACAN is an
acronym for TACtical Air Navigation. TACAN is used by military aircraft to

tail pipe (engine exhaust system component). The part of the exhaust system of
either a reciprocating engine or a gas turbine engine through which the exhaust
gases leave the engine. If a muffler is installed in the exhaust system of a
reciprocating engine, the tail pipe usually connects to the muffler and carries the
exhaust gases away from the airplane.
tail rotor (helicopter component). The small, auxiliary rotor installed on the tail

that slides, or telescopes, into a hardened steel sleeve. The pin is spring-loaded
outward, and a T-handle, extending out from the center of the pin and sleeve,
can be twisted to lock the pin in the sleeve.
A telescoping gage with the correct range of measurement is put in the hole
whose inside diameter is to be measured, and the lock is released. The spring

pushes the pin and the sleeve against the sides of the hole. The gage is held level
across the hole, and the lock is tightened. The gage is then removed from the
hole, and its length is measured with a micrometer caliper.

device used with a ratiometer-type thermometer. A length of small-diameter
nickel wire is wound around an insulator and enclosed in a thin stainless steel
tube. This bulb is surrounded by the medium whose temperature is to be
measured so the nickel wire can reach the same temperature as the medium. The

which some of its hardness and brittleness are removed. The steel is first
hardened by heating it to the correct temperature and then quenching it in oil,
water, or brine. This makes the steel hard, but also brittle. The hard steel is then
reheated, but to a lower temperature, and held at this temperature for a specified
period of time. It is then allowed to cool to room temperature in still air. This
reheating and cooling is called tempering.
template (layout tool). An outline pattern made of sheet metal, plastic, or heavy
paper that can be traced on the material of which a part is to be made. Much time
is saved by using a template rather than having to lay out the outline of the part
from the engineering drawing each time a part is to be made.

temporary flight restriction (TFR). Restrictions to flight imposed in order to: (1)
Protect persons and property in the air or on the surface from an existing or
imminent flight associated hazard; (2) Provide a safe environment for the
operation of disaster relief aircraft; (3) Prevent an unsafe congestion of
sightseeing aircraft above an incident; (4) Protect the President, Vice President,

operations. Pilots are expected to check appropriate NOTAMs during flight
planning when conducting flight in an area where a TFR is in effect.

tensiometer. A precision instrument used to measure the tension on a steel
control cable installed in an aircraft. The tensiometer holds the cable at two

specific amount. The amount of force needed to deflect the cable is measured,
and this value is used on a chart to determine the tension on this particular type
and diameter of cable.
tension. Maintaining an excessively strong grip on the control column, usually
resulting in an overcontrolled situation.
tension adjusters (aircraft control system components). Devices used in the
control system of some large aircraft to maintain a constant tension on the
control cables as the aircraft dimensions change because of changes in
temperature. The dimensions of the large mass of aluminum of which an
airplane is made change a great deal from the time the plane leaves a hot ramp
until it reaches the subzero temperatures of high altitude. If tension adjusters
were not used, the control cables would become too loose when the metal
contracts and the airplane becomes smaller.
tentative calculated landing time. See TCLT.
tera. The metric prefix that means a million million, or 1 x 1012.
terbium. A soft, silvery-gray, rare-earth, metallic chemical element. Terbium’s

“T” structure) designed to allow aircraft to enter a protected area with
guaranteed obstacle clearance and signal reception where the initial approach
course is intercepted. The TAA normally provides a NoPT (“no procedure turn”)
for aircraft using the approach. The TAA is not found on all RNAV approaches;
when the TAA is published, it replaces the minimum safe altitude (MSA) for
that approach procedure..

system receives radar data and aircraft flight plan information that is then
presented to air traffic controllers on monitors at over 162 radar control facilities
and hundreds of FAA and contract control towers. The system consists of
processors and displays that present air traffic controllers with the total airspace
picture. Controllers use automation to provide ATC service to pilots in the
airspace immediately around major airports. These ATC services include the
separation and sequencing of air traffic, conflict and terrain avoidance alerts,
weather advisories, and radar vectoring for departing and arriving traffic. Some
currently-used TAS tracking systems include ARTS IIE, ARTS IIIA, ARTS
IIIE, STARS, and MEARTS. See also digital terminal automation system
(DTAS).

subscribers, through a service provider, in text to the cockpit or to a gate printer.
In addition, TDLS emulates the flight data input/output (FDIO) information
within the control tower.
terminal Doppler weather radar (TDWR). At many U.S. airports this type of
radar is used to look at the airspace around and over the airport for detection of
microbursts, gust fronts, wind shifts and precipitation intensities. TDWR
products advise the controller of wind shear and microburst events impacting all
runways and the areas 1 ⁄2 mile on either side of the extended centerline of the
runways out to 3 miles on final approach and 2 miles out on departure.
terminal mode. In flying an activated GPS or GPS (RNAV) approach procedure,
this is the FMS/RNAV sensitivity mode in which the aircraft operates when
within 30 NM of an airport. In the terminal mode of the FMS/GPS RNAV unit,
the required navigation performance sensitivity of the course deviation indicator
becomes 1 NM. Also called approach arm mode.
terminal radar approach control (TRACON). A facility that provides radar and
nonradar services at major airports. The primary responsibility of each

secured with a lock washer and nut. Some terminal strips have barriers between
adjacent studs to keep the wires from shorting between the studs.

terminal velocity. The maximum speed a freely falling object can reach when
falling through the air. At the terminal velocity, the wind resistance trying to
slow down the object exactly balances the force of acceleration trying to speed
up the object.
terminal velocity descent (balloon operation). A term used by balloonists for the
speed obtained when the balloon is allowed to fall until it apparently stop
accelerating, at which point the envelope acts as a parachute and its vertical
speed is no longer affected by its lifting gas, but only by its shape (which is
caused by design), load, and other factors.
terminal VFR radar service. A national program instituted to extend the terminal
radar services provided instrument flight rules (IFR) aircraft to visual flight rules
(VFR) aircraft. The program is divided into four types service referred to as

into aviation gasoline to improve its antiknock quality by increasing its critical
pressure and temperature.
tetrahedron (wind direction indicator). A large, lightweight framework made in
the shape of a tetrahedron, a triangular-shaped solid. The framework is covered
with thin metal, wood, or fabric and is painted a bright color. It is mounted on a
pivot so it is free to swing with the wind, and is installed near the center of an
airport beside the runway, where it is easily visible from the air. The tetrahedron
always points into the wind and shows pilots approaching the airport the correct
direction to make their landing approach.

magnetic north and true north.
An azimuth scale (a scale that measures the horizontal direction the telescope
moves) measures the bearing from the theodolite to any object visible through
the telescope. A vertical scale measures the angle the telescope is inclined
upward from its level position.
In weather observation, the theodolite is used to track the movement of a

altitudes. A theodolite is also used with a ceiling light to measure the height of
the base of clouds at night.

a constant-flow oxygen system to increase the flow of oxygen to a mask being
used by a passenger known to have a heart or respiratory problem.
thermal (meteorology). A column of rising air. Buildings and automobile traffic
heat the air above cities and this heated air rises in a column, called a thermal.
Sailplanes gain altitude by circling in a thermal and being carried upward by it.
Thermals are easily found, because clouds normally form at their top. Air
containing water vapor is carried upward until it reaches a level at which the
vapor condenses and becomes visible droplets of liquid water. These droplets
form the cloud.
thermal anti-icing system (TAI). An aircraft anti-icing system that uses hot air to
prevent ice forming on the leading edges of the wings and tail surfaces. Hot air
from the turbine-engine compressor or from a shroud around the exhaust system
of a reciprocating engine flows through ducts in the leading edges of the wings
and tail surfaces to heat them so ice cannot form on them.

thermal barrier (high-speed aerodynamics). A term used to describe one of the
limits to the speed at which an aircraft can fly. The thermal barrier is the speed
limit caused by heat produced by friction of the air passing over the aircraft
surfaces. At this speed, the heat is severe enough to damage the aircraft
structure.
thermal circuit breaker. A type of circuit breaker that opens an electrical circuit
when excessive current flows through it. Movable contacts are mounted on a
bimetallic strip which is bent in such a way that they are forced tightly against
fixed contacts in the circuit breaker housing. When more current than the circuit
breaker is designed to carry flows through the bimetallic strip, the strip heats up
and warps. When it warps, it snaps the contacts apart and opens the circuit.
thermal circulation (meteorology). Atmospheric circulation caused by the
heating and cooling of air.
thermal coefficient of resistance. The ratio of the change in resistance of a
material to a change in its temperature. The coefficient is positive if the
resistance of the material increases as its temperature goes up. The coefficient is
negative if the resistance becomes less as the material gets hotter. The thermal
coefficient of resistance is usually expressed in such units as ohms per degrees
Celsius (Ω/°C).
thermal conduction. A method of heat transfer in which heat energy is
transferred from one body into another when the bodies are in direct contact.
thermal conductor. A material that transfers heat energy by conduction with very
little loss. Most metals are good thermal conductors, and such materials as paper,
wood, and water are poor thermal conductors, or are thermal insulators.
thermal crossover (electronic display). The natural phenomenon that normally
occurs twice daily when temperature conditions are such that there is a loss of
contrast between two adjacent objects on infrared imagery.
thermal cutout (electric motor component). A special circuit breaker mounted
inside an electric motor. The thermal cutout opens the power lead to the motor if
the motor overheats for any cause. These causes could be: too great a load, too
low an operating speed, or lack of cooling airflow. As soon as the motor cools
down, the thermal cutout automatically resets itself, and the motor runs again.
Thermal cutouts are also called automatic-reset circuit breakers.

change in the physical dimensions of a material as the temperature of the
material changes. The thermal expansion coefficient of aluminum is
approximately twice that of steel.

cooling.
thermal index (TI) (soaring). For any given level is the temperature of the air
parcel having risen at the dry adiabatic lapse rate (DALR) subtracted from the
ambient temperature. Experience has shown that a TI should be –2 for thermals
to form and be sufficiently strong for soaring flight.
thermal insulator. A material that does not conduct heat. It is used to prevent the
transfer of heat from one point to another.
thermalling (glider operations). Locating and utilizing thermals for soaring flight
in order to gain altitude (also referred to as “thermal soaring”). The thermal,
which is a rising mass of buoyant air in a vertical, convective current, contains
“plumes” or “bubbles” that provide lift for soaring flight. The pilot first attempts
to find thermals by being aware of lift indicators, and then uses the thermal’s
plume or bubbles to gain altitude by first entering a thermal, then centering it,
and finally leaving it. (See also centering.)
thermally actuated switch (electrical component). A switch whose contacts are
actuated by changing temperature. The contacts are normally mounted on a
bimetallic strip that warps when its temperature changes. When the strip warps,

the contacts either snap closed or snap open, depending on whether the switch is
actuated by a descending or a rising temperature.

thermal relief valve (hydraulic system component). A pressure relief valve in a
hydraulic system that relieves the pressure which builds up when heat expands
the fluid. Thermal relief valves are installed in sections of the system in which
fluid can be trapped, usually in the lines between the selector valves and the
actuators. When fluid in these lines absorbs heat and expands, the thermal relief
valve momentarily unseats and releases enough fluid back into the system return
manifold to relieve the high pressure and prevent damage to the system.
thermal runaway (nickel-cadmium battery malfunction). A condition that can
occur in a nickel-cadmium battery in which the battery overheats because of
excess current. A nickel-cadmium battery has a very low internal resistance, but
if an excessive amount of current flows from it, even its low resistance will
cause it to overheat. The center cells get hotter than the outer cells, which
transfer some of their heat to the outside air, and when the center cells overheat,
their voltage and resistance both drop.
When the generator puts current back into the battery, the center cells take the
most current and get even hotter. As they get hotter, their voltage and resistance
continue to drop, and they take more current. This current increase continues
until the battery is destroyed.
thermal shock (engine operating condition). The rapid change in engine
operating temperature that occurs when engine power is suddenly reduced at the
same time the airspeed, thus the cooling, is increased. Thermal shock occurs
when an aircraft is required to rapidly descend to a lower altitude.

thermoplastic resins caused by exposure to elevated temperatures. See crazing.

thermal turbulence (soaring). Thermals, or rising columns of air, in the boundary
layer generated by uneven surface heating.

streets, that are excited by convection disturbing an overlying stable layer. Also
called convection waves.
thermionic current. The flow of electrons in a vacuum tube from a heated
cathode to a positively charged anode, or plate. When the cathode is heated,
electrons gain so much energy that their orbits increase in size enough for them
to be influenced by the positive voltage on the plate. They leave the cathode and
flow to the plate.
thermistor. A semiconductor device whose electrical resistance varies with its
temperature. The resistance of a thermistor material decreases as its temperature
increases. Thermistor materials are used in fire detection systems. When the
thermistor is cold, its resistance is high, but when it is heated in a fire, its
resistance drops enough to operate the fire warning system.

thermistor material. A material with a negative temperature coefficient that
causes its resistance to decrease as its temperature increases.
thermoammeter. An ammeter used to measure the radio-frequency (RF)
alternating current flowing in a circuit. The RF current flows through a short
piece of resistance wire and heats it. The amount the wire is heated is
proportional to the square of the current flowing through it.
A thermocouple is welded to the center of the resistance wire, and a DC
ammeter measures the current produced by the thermocouple. This current is
proportional to the temperature of the resistance wire. The dial of the
thermocouple instrument is calibrated in amps of RF alternating current.
thermocouple. A device used to generate a small electrical current. A
thermocouple is made up of two dissimilar metal wires, such as iron and
constantan, copper and constantan, or chromel and alumel. The ends of these
wires are joined to form a loop. Electrical current flows through the wires when

there is a temperature difference between the junctions, the points at which the
wires join. The amount of current flowing in the loop is determined by three
things:
1. The types of metals used for the wires
2. The temperature difference between the two junctions
3. The resistance of the thermocouple wires
Iron and constantan or copper and constantan thermocouples are used to
measure the cylinder head temperature of reciprocating engines, and chromel
and alumel thermocouples are used to measure the exhaust gas temperature in
both reciprocating and gas turbine engines.

thermocouple fire detection system. A fire detection system that works on the
principle of the rate-of-temperature-rise. Thermocouples are connected in series
and installed in various locations in the area to be protected. One thermocouple
is surrounded by insulation that prevents its temperature changing rapidly.
In the event of a fire, the temperature of all the thermocouples except the
protected one will rise immediately and a fire warning will be initiated. In the
case of a general overheat condition, the temperature of all the thermocouples
will rise uniformly and since there is no temperature difference between the
thermocouples, there will be no fire warning.

thermocouple house thermal (meteorology). A thermal that forms frequently in
the same or similar location.

thermodynamic diagram. In general, this type of chart can represent the
thermodynamic states of a material, typically a fluid; in meteorology it is used to
show an analysis of the state of the atmosphere with the results derived from
radiosonde measurements (usually obtained by weather balloon). It presents
plotted isopleths (showing the equal or connecting points of the isobars and
isotherms) of values of pressure, temperature, and water vapor content, as well
as dry and saturated adiabats. Various forms of this chart exist for many different
purposes in science and engineering, the most commonly used in meteorology in
the U.S. being the “skew-T/log-P” chart. See adiabat; skew-T chart.

junction of two metals. The current flowing in a thermocouple circuit is a form
of thermoelectricity.

thermometer. An instrument used to measure temperature. Some thermometers
measure the change in the volume of a liquid caused by its expansion or
contraction with changes in its temperature. Others measure the change in
pressure of a confined gas as its temperature changes. Electrical thermometers
measure the current produced in a thermocouple as the temperature difference
between the thermocouple junctions changes, and resistance thermometers
measure temperature by measuring the current forced by a constant voltage
through a resistance that changes with the temperature.
thermonuclear action. The release of energy that takes place when the nucleus of
one element is changed into the nucleus of another element by the action of heat.
thermopile. An assembly of thermocouples connected together. These
thermocouples can be connected in series to get a higher voltage or in parallel to
get a larger amount of current. Thermopiles are used to measure temperature or
to change electromagnetic radiant energy into electrical power.

thermoplastic material. A type of plastic material that becomes soft when it is
heated, and hardens when it is cooled. Thermoplastic materials can be softened
and hardened many times without the strength or quality of the material being
affected. Transparent acrylic plastic resin is an example of a thermoplastic
material.
thermosetting material. A type of plastic material that, when once hardened by
heat, cannot be softened by being heated again. Phenolic resin is an example of a
thermosetting material.
thermosphere. The highest layer of the atmosphere that begins above the
mesosphere and gradually fades away into space.
thermostat. A temperature-sensitive electrical switch. A thermostat is used with a
combustion heater to control the temperature of the air inside the cabin of an
aircraft. The thermostat contains an electrical switch that closes when the
temperature drops to a preset value. Current flowing through the closed switch
opens the heater fuel valve, allowing the heater to begin heating the air. When
the cabin air temperature rises to the upper value for which the thermostat is set,
the switch opens, and the fuel valve shuts off the flow of fuel to the heater.
thermostatic bypass valve (reciprocating engine lubricating system component).
A temperature-sensing valve in an oil cooler that opens when the oil is cold and
allows it to flow around the core of the cooler, between the core and the cooler
jacket. When the oil is hot, the bypass valve closes and forces the oil to flow
through the core of the cooler.
thermostatic expansion valve (air conditioning system component). The
component in a vapor-cycle cooling system that meters the refrigerant into the
evaporator. The amount of refrigerant metered by the thermostatic expansion
valve, or TXV, is determined by the temperature and pressure of the refrigerant
as it leaves the evaporator coils. The TXV changes the refrigerant from a highpressure liquid into a spray of low-pressure liquid.
thermoswitch. An electrical switch that closes a circuit when it is exposed to a
specified high temperature.
thickness gage. A precision measuring tool made of a series of narrow strips of
steel. Each strip is ground to an accurate thickness with the thickness marked on

over the threads of the bolt to produce a clamping action that holds parts of a
machine together. A threaded bolt is a form of inclined plane.
thread (textiles). Long filaments made by twisting together short lengths of
natural fibers, such as cotton or linen, to form a continuous strand. Threads of

generator with three sets of windings. The three windings are arranged in such a
way that the current and voltage in each winding is 120 electrical degrees out of
phase with the current and voltage in either of the other two windings.
The three windings can be connected in either a delta or a Y-arrangement. In a
delta connection, the three windings are connected in series. The voltage across

any one of the three windings is the same as that across the other windings. The
total current is 1.73 times the current through any of the individual windings.
In a Y-connected three-phase circuit, one end of each of the windings is
connected to a common neutral point. The voltage across any two windings is
1.73 times the voltage between any single winding and the neutral point. The
current through any two windings is the same as the current through any single
winding.

three-point landing (aircraft operation). A full-stall landing of an airplane
equipped with a tail wheel. In a three-point landing, the main wheels and the tail
wheel touch the ground at the same time. A three-point landing with a tail wheel

contacts, controlled by a single operating handle. A three-pole, single-throw
switch can select two conditions, such as on and off, in three separate circuits.

three-state buffer. A digital logic device used as a switch in an integrated circuit
chip. When there is a logic low on the control line, the device acts as a closed
switch with the in and out lines connected, a low on the in line produces a low

on the out line, and a high on the in line produces a high on the out line. When
there is a high on the control line, the device acts as an open switch, placing a
high impedance between the in and the out lines.

extremely noisy area such as the cockpit of an airplane. The throat microphone is
strapped around the person’s neck so the sensitive pickup rests over the larynx

(the part of the throat containing the vocal cords). When the person wearing the
microphone talks, vibrations of the larynx vibrate the microphone and produce
an electrical signal that can be changed into sound.

power or thrust the pilot wants the engine to develop.
throttle body (fuel metering system component). The component in a
reciprocating engine fuel metering system through which all of the air that flows
into the engine must pass. A throttle valve controls the amount of air flowing
into the engine, and the main metering system meters the proper amount of fuel
for this air.
throttle ice (carburetor ice). A type of ice that forms on the throttle valve of an
aircraft carburetor when the throttle is partially closed. The temperature drop
caused by the pressure drop across the partially closed throttle valve, and by the
evaporation of the fuel, forces moisture to condense out of the air and freeze on
the throttle-valve plate.
through bolts (reciprocating engine component). Long threaded rods that extend
across the crankcase of an aircraft reciprocating engine to hold the crankcase
halves together. The through bolts pass through the cylinder base flanges of one
cylinder on each side of the crankcase, and nuts on the through bolts hold the
cylinders to the crankcase, as well as holding the halves of the crankcase
together.
throw (reciprocating engine crankshaft). The offset in the crankshaft of a
reciprocating engine to which the connecting rods are attached. Radial engines
have only one throw for each row of cylinders. In-line and horizontally opposed
engines normally have one throw for every cylinder, and V-engines have one
throw for each pair of cylinders.
throwaway part. A part of a mechanism designed and built in such a way that it
is not economically repairable. When the part fails, it is more economical to
throw it away and put in a new one than it would be to repair it.
throw-over control (airplane controls). A type of airplane control wheel that may
be moved from in front of the left seat to a position in front of the right seat. This
is done so the airplane can be flown from either seat. To throw the wheel over, a
pin in the control column is released, and the upper part of the column on which
the wheel is mounted pivots so it can be moved from one side to the other.

thrust (aerodynamic force). The forward aerodynamic force produced by a
propeller, fan, or turbojet engine as it forces a mass of air to the rear, behind the
airplane. A propeller produces its thrust by accelerating a large mass of air by a

smaller mass of air by a much larger amount. The mass and acceleration of the
air moved by a fan is between those of the propeller and the jet.

to change the attitude of a space vehicle.
thrust horsepower (reciprocating or turboprop engine). The actual amount of
horsepower an engine-propeller combination transforms into thrust.
thrust horsepower (turbojet or turbofan engine). The horsepower equivalent of
the thrust produced by a turbojet or turbofan engine. Since power requires
movement, thrust horsepower must take into consideration the speed of the
aircraft in which the engine is mounted.
Thrust horsepower may be found by multiplying the net thrust, measured in
pounds, by the speed of the aircraft measured in miles per hour or feet per
second. This value is then divided by a constant.

shaft of an engine installed in an airplane.

thrust loading. The gross weight of an aircraft, in pounds, divided by the thrust,
in pounds, produced by the engines.

between the thumb and first finger. Thumbscrews are used to lock one part to
another when the parts must be locked and released without the use of tools.
thunder (meteorology). The loud rumbling sound caused by lightning. When
lightning (a large spark) jumps from one cloud to another or from a cloud to
ground, a great amount of heat is produced. This heat causes the air to expand
violently, and this expansion causes shock waves that travel outward at the speed
of sound. These shock waves cause the noise we know as thunder.
thundercloud (meteorology). The commonly used name for a cumulonimbus
cloud. Violent up and down air currents inside the cloud produce static
electricity that discharges in the form of lightning. Lightning causes the thunder
heard inside thunderclouds.

or more in

thyratron (electronic component). A hot-cathode, gas-filled electron tube in
which one or more control electrodes start a flow of electrons between the
cathode and anode. A pulse of high voltage on the control grid ionizes the gas
inside the tube and allows electrons to flow. The grid loses its control as soon as
the electrons begin to flow, and the only way to stop the flow is to reduce the
anode voltage to a value that no longer attracts the electrons.
thyrector (electronic component). A special type of semiconductor device used
to protect a piece of electronic equipment from being damaged by spikes of
voltage. A thyrector contains two zener diodes, connected together back to back.
When the circuit voltage is below that for which the diodes are rated, no current
flows through them. But if a spike of voltage occurs in the circuit, one of the
diodes breaks down and conducts the spike to ground. Since the zener diodes are
connected back to back, the thyrector protects against spikes of voltage of either
polarity.

thyristor (electronic component). A semiconductor device used as an electrically
controlled switch. Two of the most widely used thyristors are silicon controlled
rectifiers (SCRs) and triacs. An SCR is a semiconductor device that does not
normally allow electrons to flow through it in either direction. However, if a
pulse of voltage of the correct polarity is applied to a third electrode, the gate,
the SCR conducts in its forward direction.
The SCR continues to conduct until the voltage across it drops to zero. Once
electrons stop flowing through it, the SCR remains shut off until another pulse of
voltage is applied to its gate. The triac begins to conduct when a pulse of voltage
of either polarity is applied to its gate. Once conducting, it can be turned off only
by reducing the voltage across it to a value low enough to stop the current
flowing through it.

applied to the circuit. Time constant is determined by the amount of both
resistance and capacitance in the circuit.
time constant (inductive circuit value). The amount of time, measured in
seconds, needed for the current flowing through an inductive circuit to reach
63.2% of its final value. Time constant is determined by the amount of both
resistance and inductance in the circuit.

coordinator are used to change heading a definite number of degrees in a given
time.
time group (air traffic control). Four digits representing the hours and minutes of
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), based on the 24-hour clock system. In this
system, the day begins at 0000 and ends at 2359, and is the time along the prime
meridian. The FAA uses UTC for all operations and identifies it as Zulu time, or
Z time. For example, 0205Z indicates the reference time of 2:05 a.m.
The word “local” or the time zone equivalent is used when local time is given
during radio and telephone communications. When written, a time zone
designator is used to indicate local time. For example, 0205M is 2:05 a.m.

marked on its face and a weighted pointer mounted on a bearing in its center.
When the disk is clamped onto the end of the propeller shaft of an aircraft
reciprocating engine, the pointer points directly upward. The disk rotates with
the propeller but the pointer continues to point straight upward and indicates on
the scale the number of degrees the shaft has rotated. The timing disk is used
with a top-dead-center indicator to position the crankshaft of the engine for valve
and ignition timing.

intrusion into controlled airspace or an ADIZ; noncompliance with issued flight
restrictions/security procedures; or unlawful interference with airborne flight
crews, up to and including hijack. In certain circumstances, an object may
become a TOI based on specific and credible intelligence pertaining to that
particular aircraft/object, its passengers, or its cargo.

track of interest resolution. The resolution of a track of interest (TOI), usually
occurring when the aircraft/object is no longer airborne; the aircraft complies
with air traffic control instructions, aviation regulations, and/or issued flight

is verified to be nonthreatening/nonhostile; TOI was identified based on specific
and credible intelligence that was later determined to be invalid or unreliable; or
displayed data is identified and characterized as invalid.

in performing traffic flow management, a collaborative effort to manage aircraft
operating within the national airspace system (NAS). It consists of an automated
data processing system that supports the FAA traffic management functions
within ARTCCs and ATC. Traffic management personnel and ATC analyze the
demand on the NAS and implement initiatives that are relayed to enroute and
terminal controllers. Those controllers, along with other system users, relay
information to traffic management personnel for use in their decision-making
process.
traffic information service (TIS). An air traffic control service provided by the
FAA that transmits traffic information to the cockpit via data link. It is similar to
the VFR radio traffic advisories normally received over voice radio, but is
available in the cockpit via an automatic display that informs the pilot of nearby
traffic and potential conflict situations. The display assists the pilot in the visual
acquisition of traffic; TIS is intended to improve the safety and efficiency of the
“see and avoid” awareness that pilots must exercise in flight. TIS also employs
an enhanced capability of the terminal Mode S radar system, which contains
surveillance data as well as the data link required to uplink the information to
suitably-equipped aircraft (called the “TIS client”). TIS surveillance data is
derived from the same radar used by ATC, and is uplinked to the client aircraft
on each radar scan, normally every 5 seconds. See also traffic information
service – broadcast (TIS-B).
traffic information service-broadcast (TIS-B). (1) An air traffic surveillance
system that combines all available traffic information on a single display. (2)
Supplement to ATS-B, and provides an integration of data input from other
sources that don’t have the GPS/Mode S data link. This is particularly valuable

where ground radar returns can be added and also for airport surface movement
control where the surface radar information can be integrated.

traffic situation display (TSD). TSD is a computer system that receives radar
track data from all 20 CONUS ARTCCs, organizes this data into a mosaic
display, and presents it on a computer screen. The display allows the traffic

management coordinator multiple methods of selection and highlighting of
individual aircraft or groups of aircraft. The user has the option of
superimposing these aircraft positions over any number of background displays.
These background options include ARTCC boundaries, any stratum of en route
sector boundaries, fixes, airways, military and other special use airspace,
airports, and geopolitical boundaries. By using the TSD, a coordinator can
monitor any number of traffic situations or the entire systemwide traffic flows.

a pulse whose voltage is higher than the reference voltage, the trailing edge is
the part of the pulse where the voltage goes from the high value back to the
reference value.
trailing edge flap (airplane secondary control). Flaps mounted on the trailing
edge of an airplane wing. Trailing edge flaps are extended in flight to increase
the camber of the airfoil section. This increases both the lift and the drag
produced by the airfoil.

center of the rear spar at the next compression strut outboard. The drag and
antidrag wires are adjusted until the distance between the center of the rear spar
at the inboard compression strut and the center of the front spar at the next
outboard compression strut is exactly the same as that between the first points
measured.
trammel bar. A wood or metal bar on which trammel points are mounted to
compare distances.

hole, and the end of the punch is flat; but there is a short, sharp point protruding
from its center. This point makes a small impression in the metal that is used to
start a drill at the location the rivet hole is to be drilled.

transformer (electrical component). An electrical component used to change the
voltage and current in an alternating current circuit. The core of a transformer is
made of a stack of soft iron laminations, and the windings, which consist of
several coils of insulated wire, are wound around the core. The winding
connected to the power source is called the primary winding, and the windings
connected to the electrical loads are called secondary windings.
The voltage difference between that across the primary winding and that across
any one of the secondary windings is directly proportional to the ratio of the
number of turns in the secondary winding to the number of turns in the primary
winding. The higher the ratio, the higher the secondary voltage.
The current difference between that in the primary winding and that in the
secondary winding is inversely proportional to the ratio of the number of turns in

the secondary winding to the number of turns in the primary winding. The higher
the ratio, the lower the secondary current.

transformer/rectifier. See T/R.
transistor (electronic component). An active semiconductor device with three
electrodes: an emitter, a collector, and a base. A large flow of electrons between
the emitter and the collector is controlled by a much smaller flow of electrons
between the emitter and the base. Transistors are physically small, require
almost no power for their operation, are extremely rugged, and are low in cost.
See NPN transistor and PNP transistor.
transistor voltage regulator (aircraft electrical system component). A type of
voltage regulator used in an aircraft electrical system to control the output
voltage of an alternator. A zener diode senses the alternator output voltage, and
power transistors control the amount of current flowing through the alternator
field coil.
A transistor voltage regulator is not the same as a transistorized voltage
regulator. In a transistorized voltage regulator, the alternator or generator output
voltage is sensed by an electromagnetic relay. Only a small amount of current
flows through the relay contacts, just the base current of an output transistor that
controls the larger alternator field current.

a pilot to fly types of aircraft not previously flown, such as tailwheel aircraft,
high-performance aircraft, and aircraft capable of flying at high altitudes.
translational lift (helicopter operation). The additional lift produced by a
helicopter rotor as the helicopter changes from hovering to forward flight. The
lift produced by a helicopter rotor decreases as the helicopter rises vertically out
of ground effect. But if the helicopter moves forward at an airspeed of
somewhere around 15 to 20 miles per hour, the rotor system becomes more
efficient in forcing the air downward, and the lift increases. This increased lift
caused by the forward motion of the helicopter is called translational lift.
transition altitude (QNH). The altitude in the vicinity of an airport at or below
which the vertical position of an aircraft is controlled by reference to altitudes
(MSL).
transition area (air traffic control). Controlled airspace extending upward from

designated in conjunction with airway route structures or segments. Unless
otherwise limited, transition areas terminate at the base of the overlying
controlled airspace.
Transition areas are designated to contain IFR operations in controlled airspace
during portions of the terminal operation, and while transitioning between the
terminal and en route environment.

transonic flight. Flight in which an airplane transitions from subsonic speed to a
speed at or beyond the speed of sound. Transonic flight is considered to be

between about 600 and 900 miles per hour, a speed of between Mach 0.8 and
Mach 1.2. At this speed, some air passing over the aircraft is subsonic and other
air is supersonic. Abrupt changes in the flight characteristics of an airplane take
place in transonic flight.

the hot-gas chamber wall at the desired temperature.
transponder (radar beacon transponder). The airborne radar beacon
receiver/transmitter portion of the air traffic control radar beacon system
(ATCRBS). The transponder automatically receives radio signals from
interrogators on the ground, and it selectively replies from a specific reply pulse
or pulse group only to those interrogations being received on the mode to which
it is set to respond. See radar beacon transponder.

adjacent rows. Transverse pitch is also called rivet gage. See illustration for gage
(rivet).
transverse-flow effect (helicopter aerodynamics). A condition in helicopter
forward flight when the air flowing through the rear of the disc is more
perpendicular than that flowing through the front. This flow causes a decreased
angle of attack and the tendency of the rear of the disc to descend. Precession
causes the effect to be felt 90° in the direction of rotation and the helicopter has a
tendency to roll to the right.
transverse wave. A type of mechanical wave in which the material being
vibrated moves in a direction perpendicular to the direction the wave is moving.

Transverse waves are formed when a rock is thrown into a pond of water. The

the base line is plotted. Any deviation from a normal increase or decrease warns
the technician of an impending problem.
triac (electronic component). A form of thyristor, similar to a silicon controlled
rectifier, except it controls current flow in either direction. A triac acts as two
SCRs connected in parallel, with the anode of one connected to the cathode of
the other. A triac does not conduct until a pulse of voltage is applied to its gate.
But once it begins to conduct, it can be turned off only by reducing the voltage
across it to a value low enough to stop the current flowing through it. See
thyristor.

angles. The three photographs are studied with special instruments that show the
contours of the terrain. Maps are made from these photographs.
trimmed flight. A flight condition in which the aerodynamic forces acting on the
control surfaces are balanced, and the aircraft is able to fly straight and level
with no control input.
trimming (gas turbine engine operation). The procedure of adjusting the fuel
control of a gas turbine engine so the engine produces the correct maximum
RPM and idling RPM, and functions properly under acceleration and
deceleration. Trimming is done to adjust the engine performance to agree with
the performance specifications published by the engine manufacturer.
trim tab (aircraft controls). A small movable control mounted on a primary
control surface. The trim tab is adjustable in flight to change the aerodynamic
load on the control surface. The aerodynamic load produced by the trim tab
deflects the control surface enough for it to trim the aircraft for hands-off flight
at any normal speed.
trinomial (mathematical term). An algebraic expression that has three terms. A2
+ 2AB + B2 is a trinomial.
triode electron tube. An electron tube with three active electrodes: the cathode,
the control grid, and the anode, or plate. Triode electron tubes are used as

electron tubes have, to a large extent, been replaced by the much smaller and
more efficient bipolar transistors.
trip-free circuit breaker (electrical component). A circuit breaker that opens a
circuit any time an excessive amount of current flows, regardless of the position

of the circuit breaker’s operating handle. A trip-free circuit breaker cannot be
closed into an active electrical fault.
triphibian (aircraft type). An aircraft with a landing gear that allows it to operate
from dry ground, snow or ice, or water.
triplane (type of airplane). An airplane with three main supporting wings.
Triplanes were used during World War I because they were strong and
lightweight, and their short wing span made them highly maneuverable. The
additional expense and the drag produced by the third wing caused them to lose
in popularity to the biplane and later to the monoplane.
triple-slotted flap (airplane secondary control). A type of trailing-edge wing flap
used on some of the larger, high-performance airplanes. Triple-slotted flaps
extend from the trailing edge of a wing in three sections. The trailing edge of one
section forms a duct with the leading edge of the section behind it to force air
down over the top of the flap. Triple-slotted flaps prevent the airflow from
separating from the surface of the flap when they are fully extended.

triple-spool engine (gas turbine engine). A type of turbofan engine in which the
fan is the first stage of compression, or N1. The normal low-pressure compressor
is N2, and the high-pressure compressor is N3. Each stage of compressor is

consisting of turbine blades attached to the periphery of a rotating disk. Hot
gases from the combustion chamber flow through a series of nozzle vanes to
direct them into the turbine blades at the optimum angle. Torque from the
turbine wheel drives the compressor.
turbocharger (reciprocating engine component). An exhaust-gas-driven air
compressor used to increase the power of a reciprocating engine. A turbocharger
uses a small radial-inflow turbine in the exhaust system of the engine to drive a
centrifugal-type air compressor mounted on the turbine shaft. Exhaust gases spin
the turbine, and the compressor compresses air. This compressed air flows into
the cylinders of the engine through the induction system.
A turbocharger uses power from the engine because it increases the exhaust
back pressure. But the compressed air it forces into the cylinders produces a
greater power increase than the loss of power caused by the turbine.
Turbocharger is a shortened name for exhaust-driven turbosupercharger.
turbocompound engine (reciprocating engine type). A type of reciprocating
engine that recovers some of the energy normally lost through the exhaust by
using a power-recovery turbine (PRT) in the exhaust. Some of the energy
remaining in the exhaust gas leaving the cylinders is used to spin a turbine
connected through a fluid coupling to the crankshaft. A portion of this energy is
returned to the crankshaft.
turbofan engine. A type of gas turbine engine that has a set of lengthened blades
on the low-pressure compressor or low-pressure turbine. Air moved by these
special blades bypasses the core engine and produces between 30% and 75% of
the total thrust produced by the engine.

operates a turbine which in turn operates the air compressor. See also turbojet
engine.
turbojet engine. A form of heat engine that produces thrust by accelerating a

relatively small mass of air through a large change in velocity. A compressor in
the front of the engine compresses the inlet air, and fuel is sprayed into this air
and burned. The heat from the burning fuel expands the air and forces it out the
back of the engine in the form of a high-velocity jet of hot air. The air leaving
the engine flows through a turbine which extracts energy to drive the
compressor.

operates a turbine which drives the propeller. See also turboprop engine.
turboprop engine. A form of gas turbine engine that uses one or more stages of
turbines to drive a set of reduction gears, which in turn drives a propeller. Most
of the heat energy in the exhaust gases is converted into torque, rather than into a
stream of high-velocity exhaust gases, as is done in a turbojet engine.
turboshaft engine. A form of gas turbine engine that uses one or more stages of
turbines to drive a transmission, which in turn drives the rotors of a helicopter. A
turboshaft engine extracts a maximum amount of the heat energy from the
exhaust gas to drive the turbine connected to the transmission.

caused by the separation of airflow from the surface of the structure.
turn and bank indicator. The former name for a turn and slip indicator. See turn
and slip indicator.
turn and slip indicator (flight instrument). A rate gyro flight instrument that
gives the pilot an indication of the rate of rotation of the aircraft about its vertical
axis. The turn and slip indicator shows the trim condition of the aircraft and

serves as an emergency source of bank information in case the attitude gyro
fails.
The turn indicator uses a rate gyro attached through a fork and pin mechanism
to a vertical pointer. This rate gyro is installed so it measures the rate of rotation
about the vertical axis of the aircraft. The vertical pointer shows when a standard
rate turn (3° per second for some aircraft, and 11 ⁄2° per second for others) is
being made. The slip indicator is a curved glass tube partially filled with a liquid
in which a black glass ball rolls.
When the angle of bank is correct for the rate of turn, centrifugal force and
gravity are balanced, and the ball stays in the center of the tube. When the rate of
turn is too high for the angle of bank, the centrifugal force is greater than the
force of gravity and the ball rolls to the outside of the turn. When the rate of turn
is too low for the angle of bank being used, the force of gravity is greater than
the centrifugal force, and the ball rolls to the inside of the turn. Turn and slip
indicators were once called needle and ball indicators and more recently, turn
and bank indicators. See illustration for rate gyro.
turn anticipation (navigation). The capability of RNAV systems to determine the
point along a course, prior to a turn WP, where a turn should be initiated to
provide a smooth path to intercept the succeeding course, and to enunciate the
information to the pilot.
turnbuckle. An adjusting device used in a run of aircraft control cable to adjust
its tension. A turnbuckle consists of a brass barrel and two threaded cable
terminals made of steel. One terminal and one end of the barrel have left-hand
threads, and the other terminal and the other end of the barrel have right-hand
threads. The cable terminals are both started into the barrel, and as the barrel is
turned, the terminals both screw into it. Screwing the terminals into the barrel
increases the cable tension by shortening the cable.
turn coordinator (aircraft flight instrument). A rate gyro instrument that shows at
a glance when a standard-rate turn is being made. The dial has a symbol which
represents the rear of an airplane with marks that align with its wing tip when a
standard-rate turn of 3° per second is being made. A black ball in a curved glass
tube below the airplane symbol shows when the angle of bank is correct for the
rate of turn being made.
The rate gyro is mounted in a canted gimbal (a tilted mounting frame) that
allows the gyro to precess, or roll over, when the aircraft rotates about either its
vertical or longitudinal axes. The gyro sensing rotation about both axes makes

the instrument more sensitive and gives a more accurate indication of the
condition of a turn than that shown by a turn and slip indicator.
turning error (magnetic compass error). See northerly turning error.
turning vent (balloon component). A vent on the side of a hot air balloon
envelope which, when opened, allows escaping air to exit in a manner causing

in a turret. For example, a drill, a boring tool, and a chamfering tool can be
mounted in the turret. The drill is moved into the work to drill the hole. The drill
is then backed out, the turret is rotated to put the boring tool in place, and the
hole is counterbored. The boring tool is then backed out and the chamfering tool
is rotated into place. The chamfering tool is moved into the work to chamfer the
edges of the counterbored hole.
TWEB. See transcribed weather broadcast.

twin-row radial engine (reciprocating engine type). A type of radial engine with
two rows of cylinders and a single crankshaft. The cylinders of a radial engine
project out from a small crankcase that holds the crankshaft. The piston in one
cylinder attaches to a master rod whose large end goes around the crankshaft
throw, and the pistons in all of the other cylinders attach to the master rod with
link rods.
A twin-row radial engine has a two-throw crankshaft and two rows of cylinders
and two master rods. The cylinders in the rear row are staggered between those
in the front row for improved cooling. The most popular twin-row radial engines
have 14 or 18 cylinders.

twist grip (helicopter power control). The throttle control on the collective pitch
control lever. Twisting the grip controls the amount of fuel supplied to a
reciprocating engine, or the amount of power produced by a turboshaft engine.
twist stripe (flexible fluid lines). A colored stripe running along the length of a
flexible hose. If this stripe spirals around the hose, it indicates that the hose was
twisted when it was installed. Twist stripes are also called lay lines.
two-axis automatic pilot. An automatic pilot that uses a canted rate gyro, similar
to that used in a turn coordinator, to sense rotation of the aircraft about its
longitudinal and vertical axes. Output from the rate gyro controls a pair of servos
in the aileron system that keeps the wings level and the airplane stable in roll and
yaw. Two-axis automatic pilots are sometimes called wing levelers.

two-part adhesive. An adhesive packaged in two containers and mixed just
before it is used. A two-part adhesive consists of resin and an accelerator to
speed up the curing action of the resin.
two-spool engine. See dual-spool gas-turbine engine.
two-stroke-cycle engine (reciprocating engine). A simple form of reciprocating
engine that completes its operating cycle in two strokes of its piston—one down
and one up. When the piston moves up, fuel is pulled into the crankcase at the
same time the fuel-air mixture inside the cylinder is being compressed. When the
piston is near the top of its stroke, a spark plug ignites the compressed fuel-air
mixture, and the expanding gases force the piston down. Near the bottom of its
stroke, the piston uncovers an exhaust port, and the burned gases leave the
cylinder. When the piston moves farther down, it uncovers an intake port, and
fuel and air are forced from the crankcase into the cylinder.
Two-stroke-cycle engines are inefficient in their use of fuel, but their simplicity
makes them popular for powering ultralight aircraft where light weight and low
cost are paramount.
two-terminal spot-type fire detection system. A fire detection system that uses

Aluminum is difficult to solder because, when it is heated, oxides form on its
surface and prevent the solder wetting the metal. The tip of a special soldering
iron is vibrated at an ultrasonic frequency as it heats the metal and melts the flux
in the solder. This vibration breaks the oxide film away from the surface of the
metal, and it floats on top of the flux. The flux covers the hot metal and prevents
new oxides forming. Soft solder will stick to aluminum when there are no oxides
on it.

indicate inability to comply with a specific instruction, request, or clearance.
unacceptable risk (risk assessment, aeronautical decision making). A result of
risk assessment, when a pilot determines that a certain level of risk or hazard is
not manageable and is unacceptable for a certain flight. As the first task of
system safety, all possible hazards or risks are identified within practical
limitations; then those risks are assessed as to their manageability in flight, or
whether they can be reduced through some other prior action. In the case of
unacceptable risk, the pilot has determined this level of risk cannot be tolerated
and needs to be eliminated or controlled. See also acceptable risk, residual risk.
unbalanced cell (nickel-cadmium battery condition). A cell in a nickel-cadmium
battery that has become discharged to a lower level than the other cells in the

below the point at which the rotor is attached to the mast.
underspeed condition (propeller governor condition). A propeller governor is in
its underspeed condition when the engine is operating at a speed lower than the
governor calls for. The speeder spring holds the pilot valve down and the
flyweights in. With the pilot valve down, the governor directs oil in the proper
direction to decrease the pitch of the propeller blades. When the blade pitch
decreases, the RPM increases, the governor flyweights spin out to an on-speed
condition, and oil is trapped in the propeller to hold the pitch.
understanding. A basic level of learning at which a student comprehends or
grasps the nature or meaning of something.
under the hood (instrument flight training). A term that indicates that the pilot is
using a hood to restrict visibility outside the cockpit while simulating instrument

empty weight of the aircraft.
unfeather (propeller operation). To change the blade pitch of a propeller from the
feathered high pitch, which prevents air loads windmilling it, to a lower pitch.
When a propeller is unfeathered in flight, aerodynamic forces produced by air
flowing over the blades cause the propeller to turn the engine.
unfeathering accumulator. A tank that holds oil under pressure, which can be
used to unfeather a propeller.
unfrozen (air traffic control). This refers to the state of the scheduled time of
arrival (STA) tags for aircraft that are still being rescheduled by traffic
management advisor (TMA) calculations. The aircraft will remain unfrozen until
the corresponding estimated time of arrival (ETA) tag passes the preset freeze
horizon for that aircraft’s super stream class. At that point, the automatic
rescheduling will stop and the STA becomes “frozen.” See also super stream
class.
UNICOM (radio communications). A privately owned radio station located on
an airport. Pilots of aircraft operating from the airport can talk with the operator
of the UNICOM station to order service or to have the operator ready to service

increases at a uniform rate. It changes the same amount each second it moves.
uniform surface corrosion. A mild form of corrosion in which the surface of a
piece of metal is covered by the salts of corrosion, but there are no localized pits
on the surface.

has been removed, or when the rotor is operating under a low or negative G
condition.
unloading valve (hydraulic system component). A pressure control valve used in
an aircraft hydraulic system to unload the engine-driven pump when the system
pressure reaches a predetermined value. The unloading valve traps the pressure
in the pressure manifold, where it is held by the accumulator, and routes the
output of the pump back to the reservoir. When the pressure in the manifold
drops to a lower predetermined value, the unloading valve directs the pump
output back into the pressure manifold. An unloading valve is also called a
system pressure regulator. See system pressure regulator.
unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Another name for a UA or UAS. See

unmanned aircraft (UA). A device used or intended to be used for flight in the
air with no onboard pilot. UA include all classes of airplanes, helicopters,
airships, and translational lift aircraft that have no onboard pilot, but only those
aircraft controllable in three axes and, therefore, exclude traditional balloons.
The United States Air Force (USAF) refers to UA as remotely piloted aircraft
(RPA).
An unmanned aircraft system (UAS), associated with a UA, is operated by a
pilot-in-command who is responsible for remote piloting duties such as collision
avoidance, avoidance of other traffic, clouds, obstructions, and terrain, etc. This
person is assisted by a trained observer (or, a “visual observer”) who has duties
associated with collision avoidance and watching the activity of the UA, either
from the ground via a visual line-of-sight or in the air by means of a chase
aircraft. Additionally, a UAS may use a supplemental pilot, who can be available
to augment and/or assume duties of the PIC, provided he or she meets the

qualifications. UAS occasionally use both an internal and an external UA pilot,
and a supplemental pilot can take either position.

stable rate of descent or controlled flight track by a predetermined altitude,
usually 500 feet AGL.

unstable air (meteorology). A mass of air whose temperature lapse rate, the
change in temperature as the altitude changes, is greater than that of the air
surrounding it. When unstable air is forced upward by flowing up the side of a
mountain, for example, it will continue to move upward, increasing its speed as
it goes up. This causes updrafts in the air. Cumulus clouds form at the top of a
column of rising unstable air.
unusable fuel (aircraft specification). Fuel in an aircraft fuel system that will not
flow to the fuel metering system when the aircraft is in its normal flight attitude.
This fuel is also called residual fuel. The weight of unusable fuel is included in
the empty weight of the aircraft. The amount of unusable fuel and its arm are
specified in the aircraft type certificate data sheets.
unusual attitude (flight attitude). An airplane attitude not normally required for
instrument flight. Unusual attitudes may result from a number of conditions,
such as turbulence, disorientation, instrument failure, confusion, preoccupation
with cockpit duties, carelessness in cross-checking, errors in instrument
interpretation, or lack of proficiency in aircraft control.
updraft (meteorology). A localized upward current of air.
updraft carburetor (reciprocating engine component). A type of carburetor that
mounts below the intake manifold of a reciprocating engine. All of the air
flowing into the engine flows upward through the venturi.

system installed on a reciprocating engine. Upper deck pressure, also called
turbocharger discharge pressure, differs from manifold pressure by the pressure
drop across the throttle valve.
upper front (meteorology). A front aloft that does not extend to the earth’s
surface.
upset head (rivet head). The head of a rivet formed when the rivet is installed.
The upset head is also called the shop head, to distinguish it from the
manufactured head on the rivet before it is driven.

upset recovery (flight). The flight changes implemented to avoid the dangerous
condition known as an aircraft upset in which the flight attitude or airspeed of an
aircraft is outside the normal bounds of operation for which it is designed.

acrobatics, which may include spins, lazy eights, chandelles, and steep turns in
which the bank angle exceeds sixty degrees. Typical limit load factors for utility
category aircraft are +4.4g and −1.76g.
utility finish (type of aircraft finish). The finish of an aircraft that gives the
necessary tautness and fill to the fabric and the necessary protection to the metal,
but does not have the glossy appearance of a show-type finish.
U-tube manometer. A pressure measuring instrument made of a glass tube bent
into the shape of the letter U. A liquid such as water or mercury is poured into
the tube until it is filled to a given level. Either a positive or a negative pressure
applied to one end of the tube will cause the liquid to rise in one side of the tube
and drop in the other side. The difference in the level of the liquid in the two
sides of the tube is proportional to the difference in the pressure at the two ends
of the tube.

vacuum. A space in which nothing exists, a completely empty space. For
practical purposes, a vacuum is considered to be a negative pressure, or a
pressure less than that of the surrounding atmosphere.
vacuum bottle. A double-wall container used to store liquified gases such as
liquid oxygen or liquid nitrogen. A vacuum bottle is made of thin stainless steel
sheet, formed into a double-walled container. All air is pumped out of the space
between the two walls, leaving a vacuum. The walls are too thin to transfer much
heat into the bottle by conduction, and almost no heat passes across the vacuum.
A vacuum bottle is a form of Dewar flask. See Dewar flask.
vacuum capacitor (electrical component). A capacitor that uses two concentric
tubes as the plates, or conductors, and a vacuum between the tubes as the
dielectric. A vacuum capacitor has a higher breakdown voltage than a similar
capacitor that uses air as its dielectric.
vacuum distillation. A method of distilling a liquid by boiling it in a vacuum.
The material being distilled is placed in a container, and as much air as possible
is pumped from it. Because of the low pressure, the liquid boils at a lower
temperature which prevents the material being damaged by heat.
vacuum forming. A method of forming parts from thermoplastic resin by using
the weight of the atmosphere to apply pressure to the softened material. A sheet
of thermoplastic material is placed above a female die and heated to soften it.
When it is at the proper temperature, a low pressure, or vacuum, is produced
inside the die, and atmospheric pressure forces the softened material into the die.
vacuum metallizing. A method of depositing an extremely thin film of metal on
a surface. A metallic vapor is formed by evaporating the metal in a high vacuum,
or extremely low absolute pressure. This vapor is attracted to the surface to be
metallized where it forms a microscopically thin coating.

vacuum pump. An air pump used to remove air from a container. There are two
types of vacuum pumps: those that produce a very low absolute pressure (a high
vacuum) with almost no flow of air, and those that produce less vacuum (a
higher absolute pressure) but move a much larger volume of air.
vacuum tube (electronic component). An electron control valve that has most of
the air removed from the glass or metal envelope in which the electrodes are
mounted. After as much air is removed from the envelope as is practical, a
“getter” is ignited inside the tube to combine with any oxygen left inside the
envelope. See getter.
vacuum-tube voltmeter. See VTVM.
VAD winds. Velocity azimuth display (VAD) winds are derived from the output
of the 160 or more WRS-88 radar sites located throughout the United States. The
WRS-88 is configured to produce radar returns off of dust and other particulate
matter in the air, which can be used to indicate wind direction and speed at
different altitudes. VAD winds are generally reported in 1,000-foot increments.
valence electrons. Electrons that spin around the nucleus of an atom in its outer
shell. It is the number of valence electrons in an atom that determines its
chemical and electrical characteristics, and it is these electrons that can be
moved from one atom to another to produce electron, or current, flow.
All chemical elements have between one and eight valence electrons. Elements
with between one and three valence electrons are good electrical conductors.
Elements with five to eight valence electrons are electrical insulators, and
elements with four valence electrons are called semiconductors.
valence shell. The outer shell of electrons spinning around the nucleus of an
atom.
validity. The extent to which a test measures what it is supposed to measure.
valley breeze (meteorology). An anabatic wind formed during the day by the
heating of a valley floor. As the ground becomes warmer than the surrounding
atmosphere, the lower levels of air heat and rise, flowing up the mountainsides.
valve (electronic device). The British name for a vacuum tube.
valve (mechanical component). A device that regulates or controls the flow of a
fluid, either a liquid or a gas. Fluid power systems use both flow control and
pressure control valves. Aircraft pressurization systems control the cabin

pressure with outflow valves, and the fuel-air charge enters the cylinder of a
reciprocating engine through the intake valve, and the burned gases leave
through the exhaust valve.
valve clearance (reciprocating engine specification). The clearance between the
end of the valve stem and the rocker arm when the valve is seated and the cam
follower is off the cam lobe.
valve core (aircraft wheel component). A spring-loaded air valve screwed into a
metal tube installed in an aircraft wheel. When the tire mounted on the wheel is
being inflated, the stem of the valve core is depressed by the air chuck, and air
flows into the tire. When the air chuck is removed, the stem seats in the valve
core, and the air is trapped in the tire. To deflate the tire, the valve stem is
depressed, allowing air to flow out through the core.
valve duration (reciprocating engine specification). The amount of time, usually
measured in degrees of crankshaft rotation, an intake or exhaust valve remains
off its seat.
valve face (reciprocating engine component). The portion of a poppet valve that
forms a seal with the valve seat in an aircraft engine cylinder head. The valve
face is ground so it is perfectly smooth and concentric with the valve stem.

valve float (reciprocating engine operation). The condition of engine operation
in which an intake or exhaust valve does not seat when the rocker arm is off the
valve stem. It is possible for the engine to operate at a speed at which valves are
being opened at the natural, or resonant, frequency of the valve springs. If this
happens, the valve springs lose their effectiveness and will not close the valves,
and the valves will float. To prevent floating, most aircraft engine valves are
closed with more than one spring. These springs are wound with a different pitch
and of different size wire, giving them different resonant frequencies.
valve grinding (reciprocating engine overhaul procedure). The step in the
overhaul of a reciprocating engine in which the valve faces are ground to remove

all pits and the worn surface. The ground surface is smooth and perfectly
concentric with the valve stem.
valve guide (reciprocating engine component). Bronze or cast-iron sleeves
installed in the cylinder head of an aircraft reciprocating engine. The stems of
the intake and the exhaust valves ride up and down in the valve guides which
hold them in the exact center of the valve seats.
valve lag (reciprocating engine specification). The number of degrees of
crankshaft rotation after the piston passes the top or the bottom center of its
stroke at which the intake or exhaust valves open or close. For example, if the
exhaust valve closes 15° of crankshaft rotation after the piston passes over top
center and starts down on its intake stroke, the exhaust valve lag is 15°.
valve lapping (reciprocating engine overhaul procedure). The procedure in
which the intake and exhaust valves are given a final processing so they form an
airtight seal with the valve seat. A small amount of a very fine abrasive paste,
valve-grinding compound, is spread on the valve face, and the valve is placed in
the valve guide. The valve is rotated by hand to lap the valve face and seat
together to remove any material that would prevent an airtight seal.
valve lead (reciprocating engine specification). The number of degrees of
crankshaft rotation before the piston reaches the top or bottom center of its
stroke, at which the intake or exhaust valves open or close. For example, if the
intake valve opens when the crankshaft is 15° before the piston reaches the top
of the exhaust stroke, the intake valve lead is 15°.
valve lift (reciprocating engine specification). The linear distance a poppet valve
in a reciprocating engine moves off its seat when it is opened by the cam.
valve overlap (reciprocating engine operation). The portion of the operating
cycle of a four-stroke-cycle reciprocating engine in which both the intake and
the exhaust valves are off their seats at the same time. Valve overlap occurs at
the end of the exhaust stroke and the beginning of the intake stroke. Valve
overlap increases the efficiency of engine operation. The low pressure caused by
the exhaust gases leaving the cylinder helps the fresh fuel-air charge start
moving into the cylinder.
valve ports (reciprocating engine components). The openings in the cylinder
heads of a reciprocating engine through which the fuel-air mixture flows into the
cylinder and the burned gases leave.

valve seats (reciprocating engine components). Rings of hardened steel or
bronze shrunk into the soft cast-aluminum cylinder head of an aircraft
reciprocating engine. The wear caused by the continual hammering of the valves
as they close is absorbed by the valve seat, rather than allowing the hammering
to ruin the cylinder head. Valve seats are ground with a special seat grinder so
that they are perfectly concentric with the valve guide. Worn valve seats can be
removed from the cylinder head and replaced with new seats.

valve springs (reciprocating engine components). Helically wound steel-wire
springs used to close the poppet valves in the cylinders of an aircraft
reciprocating engine. Almost all aircraft engines use more than one spring to
close each of the valves.
valve spring tester (reciprocating engine overhaul equipment). A tester used to
determine the amount of force needed to compress a valve spring to a specified
height. Weak valve springs do not close the valves tightly enough, and they must
be discarded when the engine is overhauled.
valve stem (reciprocating engine component). The portion of a poppet valve that
rides in the valve guide in the cylinder head of a reciprocating engine. The
rocker arm presses on the end of the valve stem to open the valve.
valve stretch gage (reciprocating engine overhaul tool). A special gage that
measures the radius between the valve head and the valve stem. If this radius is
greater than that of the gage, the valve has been stretched and it must be
discarded.
valve timing (reciprocating engine specification). The relationship between
crankshaft rotation and the opening and closing of the intake and exhaust valves
in the cylinders of a reciprocating engine. When the valves are properly timed,
the intake valve opens a specified number of degrees of crankshaft rotation
before the piston reaches the top of the exhaust stroke. The intake valve closes a

specified number of degrees after the piston starts moving upward on the
compression stroke. The exhaust valve opens a specified number of degrees
before the piston reaches the bottom of the power stroke, and the exhaust valve
closes at the correct position of the crankshaft after the piston has started down
on its intake stroke.
valve-timing clearance (reciprocating engine specification). A specified
clearance between the end of the valve stem and the rocker arm of an air-cooled
aircraft engine equipped with solid valve lifters. The valves in one cylinder,
usually cylinder number one, are adjusted to the valve-timing clearance, and the
valve operating cam mechanism is adjusted so the valves in this cylinder open
and close when the crankshaft is in the correct position. After the cam
mechanism is adjusted, the valves are reset to the correct cold clearance. Valvetiming clearance is also called the hot, or operating, valve clearance of the
engine.
valve train (reciprocating engine components). The engine components that are
involved in timing and operating the intake and exhaust valves in the cylinder of
a reciprocating engine. The train includes the camshaft, valve lifter, push rod,
rocker arm, valves, valve springs, and retainers.
vanadium. A silvery-white, ductile, metallic chemical element. Vanadium’s
symbol is V, its atomic number is 23, and its atomic weight is 50.942. Vanadium
is used as an alloying element for steel to increase its hardness and toughness.
Vanadium steel alloyed with chromium is used to make mechanics’ hand tools.
vane-type pump (fluid pump). A constant-displacement fluid pump that uses
sliding vanes to move fluid through the pump. An eccentrically mounted shaft is
turned inside a circular housing that has an intake port on one side and an outlet
port on the other. Flat vanes are free to slide back and forth through slots in the
shaft as it turns.
As the shaft turns, the volume of the chamber connected to the intake port
increases and pulls fluid into the pump. This fluid is carried around the inside of
the pump until it reaches a point connected to the outlet port. At this point, the
vanes sliding through the shaft decrease the volume of the chamber, and fluid is
forced out of the pump. Vane-type pumps move a comparatively large volume of
fluid, but produce a relatively low pressure and are used as fuel pumps and lowpressure air pumps.
vanishing point (mechanical drawing). The point in a linear perspective drawing

at which the lines forming parallel sides of an object meet. Drawings made in
linear perspective cause the object to appear to have depth.
vapor. The gaseous state of a material. Water is normally a liquid, but when it
evaporates, it turns into invisible water vapor. Certain metals can be turned into
a vapor in the intense heat of an electric arc and the low pressure of a vacuum.
vapor-cycle air cooling system. A sealed mechanical refrigeration system used to
lower the temperature of the air in an aircraft cabin. A liquid refrigerant, such as
R-12 or R-134a, is sprayed into the evaporator coils, and as it evaporates, it
absorbs heat from the cabin air blown across the evaporator.
The refrigerant, now in its vapor form, flows from the evaporator into a
mechanical compressor where it is compressed, increasing both its temperature
and pressure. The hot, high-pressure vapor flows from the compressor through
the coils of a radiator-like condenser. Air from outside the aircraft blowing
across the condenser coils absorbs heat from the refrigerant vapor, causing it to
change back into a liquid. The liquid refrigerant now repeats its cycle through
the evaporator and picks up more heat.
vapor degreasing. A method of removing grease and oil from a metal part by
spraying it with hot vapors of a solvent such as trichlorethylene.
vaporization. The act of changing of a liquid into a vapor.
vapor lock (reciprocating engine malfunction). A condition of fuel starvation
that can occur in a reciprocating engine fuel system. If the fuel in the line
between the tank and the carburetor is heated enough to cause it to vaporize, a
bubble of fuel vapor will form in the line. If the vapor pressure of this bubble is
high enough, it will block the fuel and prevent it from flowing to the engine.
This is a vapor lock.
vapor pressure. The pressure of the vapor above a liquid needed to prevent the
liquid evaporating, or changing into a vapor. When an aircraft ascends to an
altitude at which the air pressure is lower than the vapor pressure of the fuel,
vapor leaves the fuel. The fuel “boils.” Vapor pressure is measured in pounds
per square inch at a specified temperature.
vapor separator (fuel metering system component). The component in a pressure
carburetor or fuel injection system that picks up vapors as they are released from
the fuel and return them with some fuel to one of the main fuel tanks.

vapor trail. A long trail of visible moisture left by an airplane as it flies at high
altitude through very cold air. Vapor trails are caused by the condensation of
water vapor in the exhaust gases leaving the engines. Vapor trails look like long,
thin clouds, and they are often called con-trails (condensation trails).
vapour. The British spelling of vapor.
VAPC (variable absolute pressure controller). A type of turbocharger controller
that uses a cam actuated by the engine throttle to maintain a constant upper-deck
pressure for each position of the throttle valve. A VAPC differs from an absolute
pressure controller (APC) which maintains a constant upper-deck pressure only
for full-throttle operation. The bellows in the VAPC controls the position of the
valve, but the throttle controls the position of the valve seat.
variable-angle stator vanes (gas turbine engine component). Compressor stator
vanes whose angle is controlled by fuel pressure from the fuel control unit. By
varying the stator-vane angle, the air directed into the first stages of the
compressor meets the rotor blades at an angle that minimizes the possibility of
compressor stall.
variable capacitor (electrical component). A capacitor whose capacity can be
changed. The capacity of a variable capacitor can be changed by varying the area
of the plates, the distance between the plates, or the dielectric between the plates.

variable-displacement fluid pump. A type of fluid pump whose output can be
changed to suit the demands placed on it. A centrifugal pump moves an amount
of fluid determined by the opposition at its discharge port. The less opposition
there is, the greater the amount of fluid the pump moves. Variable-displacement
piston pumps control their output by either changing the physical distance the
pistons move by using a variable wobble plate, or by changing the length of time
the intake ports of the cylinders are open.

variable-geometry aircraft. An aircraft whose wings can be moved in flight, to
change the amount of sweepback. When flying at a high speed, the wings are
sharply swept back; but for takeoff or landing, the wings are moved into a
position where there is much less sweepback.
variable-geometry air inlet duct (turbojet airplane component). The type of air
inlet duct used on a supersonic airplane. The shape and area of the inlet duct can
be varied in flight to provide the correct air velocity and pressure at the inlet of
the engine as the airspeed of the airplane changes.
variable inductor (electrical component). A coil whose inductance can be
changed. The inductance of a coil is determined by the number of turns of wire
and by the type of material used as the core. Changing either of these varies the
inductance.

variable-pitch propeller. A propeller whose pitch can be changed in flight. A
two-position propeller is one that can be set to a low pitch angle for takeoff, and
then in flight, the pitch angle can be increased for a more economical cruise. A
constant-speed propeller is a variable-pitch propeller whose pitch is controlled
by a governor to keep the RPM of the engine constant as the air loads on the
propeller change.
variable resistor (electrical component). A resistor whose resistance can be
changed by varying the length of the resistance element in the circuit. The most
commonly used variable resistors are rheostats and potentiometers. Rheostats
have two terminals, one at the end of the resistance element and one at the wiper,
or movable contact. Potentiometers have three terminals, one at either end of the
resistance element and one at the wiper.
variable restrictor (fluid flow control device). An adjustable device in a fluid
power system. A variable restrictor is usually some form of variable orifice that
controls the amount of fluid allowed to flow in a given time when it is acted on
by a specific pressure.

Variac. The registered trade name for a toroidal-wound autotransformer. A
portion of the winding is connected to the power line, and it serves as the
primary of the transformer. A carbon brush riding on a bare portion of the
winding is moved by the control knob. The position of this brush determines the
number of turns of wire used as the secondary winding. A Variac can vary the
secondary voltage from zero to approximately 117% of the primary voltage.

variation (magnetic compass error). The compass error caused by the difference
in the physical locations of the magnetic north pole, the location to which the
magnetic compass points, and the geographic north pole, the reference from
which navigational charts are drawn. Variation is shown on a chart by isogonic
lines, along which the variation is a constant number of degrees. For land
navigation, variation is called declination.
variometer (sailplane instrument). An extremely sensitive rate-of-climb or
descent indicator that measures static pressure between the static ports and an
external reference. Variometers can be mechanical or electrical and can be
compensated to eliminate unrealistic indications of lift and sink due to rapid
speed changes.
varistor (electronic component). A special type of semiconductor device whose
resistance varies as the voltage across it changes. A varistor is sometimes called
a voltage-dependent resistor (VDR).
varmeter (electrical measuring instrument). An electrical instrument used to
measure the reactive power in an alternating current circuit. Reactive power is
the power caused by the portion of the current not in phase with the voltage.
Reactive power is measured in volt-amps reactive (VARs) or kilovolt-amps
reactive (KVARs).
varnish (finishing material). A material used to produce an attractive and
protective coating on wood or metal. Varnish is made of a resin dissolved in a
solvent, and thinned until it is the proper viscosity to spray or brush. The varnish

is spread evenly over the surface to be coated, and when the solvents evaporate,
a tough film is left. Enamel is made by mixing a finely ground colored pigment
into a varnish base.
varnish (reciprocating engine damage). A hard, glass-like deposit that forms on
the cylinder walls of a reciprocating engine when the lubricating oil bakes onto
the surface. Varnish often forms on the cylinder walls of an engine that is not
operated properly when it is first run after it has been overhauled. Varnish on the
cylinder walls prevents the piston rings seating as they should.

Two V-blocks are used to hold a round object when clamping it in a vise.
V-blocks (metal). A fixture that allows a shaft to be centered and rotated to
measure any out-of-round condition.
VDP. See visual descent point.
vector (aircraft navigation). Aircraft approaching a busy terminal area are
directed from the ground by a process known as vectoring. The air traffic
controller on the ground has radar contact with the aircraft, and by giving the
pilot a vector, or a heading to fly, the aircraft can be positioned to avoid other
traffic, to fly around bad weather, or be directed to a position from which a
landing can be made.
vector (mathematics). A quantity which has both direction and magnitude.
vectored-thrust engine. A turbojet or turbofan engine whose exhaust nozzle is
mounted on a swivel in such a way that it may be rotated in flight to produce
forward, vertically upward, or rearward thrust.

vectoring. Navigational guidance by assigning headings.
vectors to final (advanced avionics). A function of FMS/RNAV units allowing
the pilot to perform a vectored approach procedure without being required to
switch manually to the nonsequencing mode and set the active waypoint and
course.
vector sum (mathematics). A single vector with the same magnitude and
direction as a number of vectors would have if they acted on a single point, one
at a time. The vector representing the vector sum is called the resultant vector, or
just the resultant.
vehicle safety operations personnel. 14 CFR §401.5: “Those persons whose job
performance is critical to public health and safety or the safety of property
during RLV or reentry operations.”
veering (meteorology). Shifting of the wind in a clockwise direction with respect
to either space or time. Veering, which is the opposite of backing, is commonly
used by meteorologists to refer to an anticyclonic shift, clockwise in the northern
hemisphere, and counterclockwise in the southern hemisphere.
velocity. A vector quantity expressing both the speed an object is moving and
the direction in which it is moving. “One hundred miles per hour” is a measure
of speed, because it tells only the rate at which an object is moving. But “one
hundred miles per hour, northward” is a measure of velocity. It tells both the rate
and the direction the vehicle is moving.
velocity turbine. A turbine designed in such a way that it is driven by forces
produced by the velocity, rather than the pressure, of the gases flowing through
the vanes. Velocity turbines are used on turbocompound engines as the power
recovery turbines (PRTs).
vendor. A person or business that sells goods or services.
veneer (wood product). A thin sheet of wood “peeled” from a log with a knife
held against the log as it is rotated in the cutter. Veneer is used for making
plywood. Several sheets of veneer are glued together, with the grain of each
sheet placed at 45° or 90° to the grain of the sheets next to it.
V-engine (reciprocating engine). A form of reciprocating engine in which the
cylinders are arranged in two banks, separated by an angle of between 45° and

90°. Pistons in two cylinders, one in each bank, are connected to each of the
crankshaft throws.
vent. An orifice, or hole, in a container that maintains the air pressure inside the
container the same as the pressure on the outside.

that extends below the aft end of the fuselage. Ventral fins are used to increase
the directional stability of an airplane.
venturi. A specially shaped restriction in a tube designed to speed up the flow of
fluid passing through it. According to Bernoulli’s principle, any time a fluid is
speeded up without losing or gaining any energy from the outside, the pressure
of the fluid decreases. Venturis are used in carburetors and in many types of
fluid control devices to produce a pressure drop proportional to the speed of the
fluid passing through them. See Bernoulli’s principle.
venturi effect. See venturi, Bernoulli’s principle.
venturi tube (gyroscopic instrument component). A specially shaped tube
mounted on the side of the fuselage, within the slipstream, of an airplane that
does not have a vacuum pump. Air flowing through the venturi produces a
negative pressure that is directed into the case of a gyroscopic instrument to pull
air into the instrument to drive the gyro. Four-inch tubes are used for gyro
horizons and directional gyros, and two-inch tubes are used for turn and bank
indicators. Venturi tubes are seldom seen on modern airplanes.
verdigris. A green or a greenish-blue deposit that forms on the surface of copper
when it is acted on by certain acids or other contaminants.
“verify” (air traffic control). A term used in ATC–pilot communications to
request confirmation of information (e.g., “verify assigned altitude”).
“verify specific direction of takeoff (or direction of turns after takeoff)” (air
traffic control). Used by ATC to ascertain an aircraft’s direction of takeoff

and/or direction of turn after takeoff. It is normally used for IFR departures from
an airport without a control tower. When direct communication with the pilot is
not possible, the request and information may be relayed through a flight service
station (FSS), dispatcher, or by other means.
vernier. A device used to allow very fine adjustments or very small
measurements to be made. A vernier coupling, for example, has two sets of
splines, or teeth. One set has 35 teeth and the other set has 36 teeth. When the
coupling is moved ahead one tooth on the 35-tooth side, it moves ahead 10.285
degrees (360 ÷ 35 = 10.285). When it is moved back one tooth on the 36-tooth
side, it moves back 10 degrees (360 ÷ 36 = 10). By moving the coupling ahead
one tooth on the 35-tooth side and back one tooth on the 36-tooth side, the shafts
joined by the coupling have been moved by an amount of only 0.285 degree.
vernier caliper. A precision measuring instrument used to make inside or outside
measurements with an accuracy in the range of 1 ⁄1000 inch, or 1 ⁄50 millimeter.
The movable jaw of the vernier caliper moves a vernier scale next to the main
scale. The distance between the end marks on the vernier scale is divided into
one more space than the same distance on the main scale.
To read the vernier caliper, read the inches, tenths, and hundredths of an inch
from the main scale opposite the zero on the vernier scale. Only one line on the
vernier scale lines up with a line on the main scale. Find this line, and it shows
the number of thousandths of an inch to be added to the number read from the
main scale. In the illustration, the zero on the vernier scale is past the 3.650
mark. The 20 line on the vernier scale lines up with a line on the main scale; so,
add 3.650 + .020 = 3.670 inch.

vernier coupling. A timing coupling used with base-mounted magnetos. The
vernier coupling allows the timing to be adjusted in increments of considerably
less than one degree.

vernier micrometer caliper. A precision measuring device calibrated in units of
one ten-thousandth of an inch. A vernier scale consisting of 11 lines (10 spaces),
is marked on the barrel of the caliper. Only one of these marks lines up with a
mark on the caliper thimble. To find the distance the caliper spindle has moved
out from its zero position, add the number of ten-thousandths of an inch shown
on the vernier scale to the number of thousandths of an inch read on the sleeve
and the thimble.
In the illustration, the thimble has moved out more than 0.222 inch, as shown
by the lines on the barrel scale and the thimble. The 4 line on the vernier scale
lines up with a line on the thimble so the final reading is 0.2224.

vernier micrometer caliper (metric). A precision measuring device calibrated in
units of one-thousandth of a millimeter. A vernier scale consisting of 6 lines (5
spaces), is marked on the barrel of the caliper. Only one of these marks lines up
with a mark on the caliper thimble. To find the distance the caliper spindle has
moved out from its zero position, add the number of thousandths of a millimeter
shown on the vernier scale to the number of millimeters read on the sleeve and
the thimble.
In the illustration, the thimble has moved out more than 8.50 millimeters, as
shown by the lines on the barrel scale, and more than 0.25 millimeters as shown
on the thimble. The 6 line on the vernier scale lines up with a line on the thimble
so the final reading is 8.756 millimeters.

vertex (air traffic control). The last fix for an arriving aircraft. Normally, it is the
outer marker of the runway in use. However, it may be the actual threshold or
other suitable common point on the approach path for the particular runway
configuration.
vertex (part of a cone). The point of a cone, or the part of the cone the greatest
distance from the base.
vertex time of arrival. See VTA.
vertical axis of an aircraft. An imaginary line passing vertically through the
center of gravity of an aircraft. The vertical axis is called the z-axis, or the yaw
axis.

vertical card compass (direction indicator). A magnetic compass that consists of
an azimuth on a vertical card, resembling a heading indicator with a fixed
miniature airplane which acts as the lubber line. The design uses eddy current
damping to minimize oscillation and lead and lag during turns.

vertical component of lift (aerodynamics). A component of flight that works
along with the horizontal component, this is the lift that acts vertically and in
opposition to weight (gravity). See also horizontal component of lift (HCL).
vertical fin (aircraft component). The fixed vertical surface in the empennage of
an airplane. The vertical fin acts as a weather vane to give the airplane
directional stability.
vertical navigation (VNAV). A function of area navigation (RNAV) equipment
that calculates, displays, and provides vertical guidance to a profile or path.
vertical navigation planning. Included within certain STARs is information
provided to help reduce the amount of low-altitude flying time for highperformance aircraft, such as jets and turboprops. An expected altitude is given
for a key fix along the route. By knowing an intermediate altitude in advance
when flying a high-performance aircraft, pilots can plan the power or thrust
settings and aircraft configurations that result in the most efficient descent in
terms of time, fuel requirements, and engine wear.
vertical separation. Separation established by assignment of different altitudes or
flight levels.
vertical-speed indicator (aircraft instrument). An instrument that gives the pilot
an indication of the rate at which an aircraft is rising or descending. A verticalspeed indicator is a pressure instrument with a calibrated restriction between the
case and a pressure bellows. When the aircraft changes altitude, the pressure
inside the case changes immediately. But because of the calibrated restriction,
the pressure change inside the bellows lags behind the pressure change in the
case.
The difference between the pressure inside and outside of the bellows causes
the bellows to expand or collapse, and this change in its dimensions causes a
pointer to move over its dial showing the pilot the rate of climb or descent.
Vertical-speed indicators are often called rate-of-climb indicators.
vertical speed mode. An FD/autopilot mode that allows constant-rate climbs and
descents by selecting a vertical speed on the flight director or autopilot control
panel.
vertical stability (aircraft stability). See directional stability.
vertical stabilizer. See vertical fin.

and/or descents and of using very short runways or small areas for takeoff and
landings. These aircraft include, but are not limited to, helicopters.
vertical tape instrument. A tall rectangular instrument that displays the quantity
of the parameter being measured by a movable strip of colored tape. The
presentation resembles a vertical bar graph.
vertical vibration (helicopter operation). Up-and-down vibration of a helicopter
caused by an out-of-track main rotor.
vertical visibility (meteorology). The distance one can see upward into a surfacebased obscuration. It is also the maximum height from which a pilot in flight can
recognize the ground through a surface-based obscuration.
vertical wind shear (meteorology). The condition produced by a change in wind
velocity (speed and/or direction) with height.
vertigo. A type of spatial disorientation caused by the physical senses sending
conflicting signals to the brain. Vertigo is specially hazardous when flying under
conditions of poor visibility. The eyes send a signal to the brain telling it the
airplane is in one condition, while the deep muscles, “the seat of the pants,” tell
the brain the airplane is in another condition. The inner ear tells still another
story, and the result is confusion—vertigo. Vertigo may cause pilot
incapacitation, but may be minimized by confidence in the indication of the
flight instruments.
very high frequency. See VHF.
very-high-frequency omnirange. See VOR.
very low frequency. See VLF.
Very signal. A type of emergency light signal used by ships and aircraft. A

cartridge. The cartridge sends up a ball of white or colored fire that can be seen
for several miles during the day or night.
vestibule. The central cavity of the bony labyrinth of the ear, or the parts of the
membranous labyrinth that it contains.
VFO (variable-frequency oscillator). An oscillator inside a communications
radio receiver that produces radio-frequency alternating current. The frequency

produced by the VFO can be changed until it is almost the same as the radio
frequency of the carrier being received. When the output of the VFO is mixed
with a continuous wave (CW) carrier, an audible signal is produced. VFOs are
used to make Morse code signals audible when they are transmitted by
continuous wave (CW) transmission. When a VFO is used in this way, it is
called a beat-frequency oscillator, a BFO.
VFR (visual flight rules). Flight rules adopted by the Federal Aviation
Administration to govern aircraft flight when the pilot has visual reference to the
ground at all times. VFR operations specify the amount of ceiling (the distance
between the surface of the earth and the base of the clouds) and the visibility (the
horizontal distance the pilot can see) that the pilot must have in order to operate
according to these rules. When the weather conditions are not such that the pilot
can operate according to VFR, he or she must use another set of rules,
instrument flight rules (IFR).
VFR aircraft. An aircraft conducting flight in accordance with visual flight rules.
VFR conditions. Weather conditions equal to or better than the minimum for
flight under visual flight rules. The term may be used as an ATC
clearance/instruction only when (1) an IFR aircraft requests a climb/descent in
VFR conditions; (2) the clearance will result in noise abatement benefits where
part of the IFR departure route does not conform to an FAA approved noise
abatement route or altitude; (3) a pilot has requested a practice instrument
approach and is not on an IFR flight plan.
VFR cruising altitude. Specific guidelines for altitudes while flying VFR. When
flying above 3,000 feet above the surface on a heading between 0° and 179°, a
pilot must fly any odd thousand foot MSL altitude +500 feet (3,500, 5,500,
7,500, etc.). While on a heading of 180° to 360°, a pilot must fly even thousands
+500 feet (4,500, 6,500, 85,00, etc.).
VFR military training routes. Routes used by the Department of Defense and
associated Reserve and Air Guard units for the purpose of conducting lowaltitude navigation and tactical training under VFR below 10,000 feet MSL at
airspeeds in excess of 250 knots IAS.
“VFR not recommended.” An advisory provided by a flight service station to a
pilot during a preflight or inflight weather briefing that flight under visual flight
rules is not recommended. To be given when the current and/or forecast weather

conditions are at or below VFR minimums. It does not abrogate the pilot’s
authority to make his/her own decision.
VFR over-the-top. 14 CFR Part 1: “The operation of an aircraft over-the-top
under VFR when it is not being operated on an IFR flight plan.”
VFR-On-Top (flight conditions). A flight condition in which a pilot flies an
aircraft according to visual flight rules (VFR) above a solid layer of clouds.
While flying in the clear above the clouds, the pilot can operate under visual
flight rules, but in order to reach VFR-On-Top conditions, the aircraft must pass
through the clouds. When flying through the clouds, the aircraft must be
operated according to instrument flight rules (IFR).
VFR terminal area chart. An aeronautical chart, drawn to a scale of 1:250,000
(one inch is equal to four statute miles). This chart depicts terminal control area
(TCA) airspace which provides for the control or segregation of all aircraft
within the TCA. The topographic and aeronautical information depicted on
terminal area charts includes visual and radio aids to navigation, airports,
controlled airspace, restricted areas, obstructions, and related data.
V-G diagram (operating flight strength limitation). A chart that is usually
included in an aircraft flight handbook that relates airspeed to load factor for a
specific weight, configuration, and altitude. It shows the positive and negative
load factor allowable for a given airspeed. It also shows the limit and ultimate
positive and negative load factors and the airspeed limit.
VHF (very-high frequency) (radio frequencies). The range of radio frequencies
between 30 megahertz (30,000,000 cycles per second) and 300 megahertz
(300,000,000 cycles per second) that are used for aviation communications and
navigation. VHF radio waves operate much like light waves, in that they travel
in straight lines and are usable only for a line-of-sight distance. VHF radio
waves do not follow the curvature of the earth.
VI (viscosity index). A measure of the change in the viscosity of a fluid with a
change in its temperature. The higher the viscosity index, the less the viscosity
changes with the temperature.
vibrating-reed frequency meter. A type of panel-mounted instrument used to
show the frequency of the alternating current being supplied to certain electrical
equipment. Metal reeds of different lengths are vibrated by an electromagnet
powered by the AC whose frequency is being measured. The reed whose

resonant frequency is the same as the frequency of the AC will vibrate with a
much greater amplitude than the other reeds. The ends of all of the reeds are
visible on the face of the instrument, and each reed is identified by the frequency
at which it is resonant. The number beside the reed seen as a wide blur is the
frequency of the AC.
vibration. A periodically reversing motion in which a body moves from one side
to the other of its at-rest position. Every physical body has a natural resonant
frequency at which it vibrates with the greatest amplitude for a given amount of
excitation.
vibration isolator. A device installed between a component and a structure to
prevent any vibrations present in the structure from being transmitted into the
component. Instruments and electronic components are mounted in aircraft with
vibration isolators to keep the shocks and vibrations from damaging them.
Vibration isolators are often called shock mounts.
vibration loop (fluid lines). A loop formed in a rigid fluid line to prevent
vibration from concentrating stresses that could cause the line to break.
vibrator (electrical component). An electromagnetic relay used to change steady
direct current into pulsating DC. Current flowing through a relay coil produces
an electromagnetic pull that opens a set of contacts that are normally held closed
by a spring. The coil and contacts are connected in series so the current flowing
in the coil stops as soon as the contacts open. When the contacts open, the coil
loses its electromagnetic pull, and the spring closes the contacts, restoring the
current to the coil. The frequency of the pulsating DC is determined by the
magnetic characteristics of the relay.
vibrator-type voltage regulator (DC generator control). A voltage control used
with some of the simpler direct current generators. The voltage sensor is an
electromagnetic relay whose coil is connected across the generator output. The
relay contacts are in the generator field circuit. As soon as the generator output
voltage reaches the value for which the voltage regulator is set, the
electromagnetic field in the relay pulls the contacts open. Field current is
reduced and the generator output voltage drops. As soon as the voltage is low
enough, the relay contacts close and field current again flows. The contacts
vibrate open and closed several hundred times a minute to hold the generator
voltage within the desired range.

vibratory torque control (reciprocating engine component). A patented coupling
between the propeller shaft and the crankshaft of the Continental Tiara series
aircraft engines. A short quill shaft absorbs torsional vibrations under certain
operating conditions, and a centrifugal lock bypasses the quill shaft under
conditions in which a solid shaft will produce less vibration. See quill shaft.
Victor airway. (1) Low altitude airspace corridor between 700 feet above ground
level to 18,000 feet. (2) Based on a centerline that extends from one VOR or
VORTAC navigation aid or intersection, to another navigation aid (or through
several navigation aids or intersections); used to establish a known route for en
route procedures between terminal areas.
video amplifier (electronic component). An electronic amplifier capable of
amplifying alternating current over a wide band of frequencies. Video amplifiers
normally amplify AC over a frequency band of from about 15 hertz to five
megahertz (5,000,000 hertz).
video map. An electronically displayed map on the radar display that may depict
data such as airports, heliports, runway center line extensions, hospital
emergency landing areas, NAVAIDs and fixes, reporting points, airway/route
center lines, boundaries, hand-off points, special use tracks, obstructions,
prominent geographical features, map alignment indicators, range accuracy
marks, and minimum vectoring altitudes.
view limiting device (instrument flight training device). A device used primarily
during instrument training to limit the view of the pilot to the instrument panel,
blocking the ability to see any outside visual references.
VIFF (vectoring in forward flight). The ability of the pilot of an aircraft
equipped with a vectored-thrust engine to change the direction of the exhaust gas
flow while the aircraft is in forward flight. VIFF allows the pilot to accomplish
flight maneuvers that are impossible with a conventional engine installation.
VI (viscosity index) improver. An additive used to produce a multiviscosity
lubricating oil. The polymer additive expands as temperature increases and
contracts as the temperature decreases. VI improvers cause the viscosity to
increase as the oil becomes hot and decrease when it becomes cold.
VIP levels (meteorology). National Weather Service categorization of radar
weather echo intensity for precipitation into six levels which are sometimes
expressed during communications as “VIP LEVEL” 1 through 6 (derived from

the component of the radar that produces the information—video integrator and
processor). The levels in relation to the precipitation intensity within a
thunderstorm are: Level 1–Weak; Level 2–Moderate; Level 3–Strong; Level 4–
Very strong; Level 5–Intense; Level 6–Extreme.
virga (meteorology). Water or ice particles falling from a cloud, usually in wisps
or streaks, and evaporating before reaching the ground.
virtual reality (VR). A form of computer-based technology that creates a sensory
experience allowing a participant to believe and barely distinguish a virtual
experience from a real one. VR uses graphics with animation systems, sounds,
and images to reproduce electronic versions of real-life experience.
viscosity. The resistance of a fluid to flow. The viscosity of a liquid is a measure
of its internal friction, or its “stiffness.”
viscosity index. See VI.
viscosity index improver. See VI improver.
viscosimeter. An instrument used to measure the viscosity of a fluid. A cup-type
viscosimeter is a specially shaped cup with an accurately sized hole in its
bottom. The cup is filled with the fluid whose viscosity is to be measured, and
the hole is opened so fluid can flow from it. The number of seconds is measured
between the beginning of the flow and the time the first break in the flow occurs.
This time relates to the viscosity of the fluid.
viscous damping. A method of damping vibration or oscillation by converting
some of the vibrational energy into heat. Viscous damping is done by allowing
the vibrating object to force a fluid, either a liquid or gas, through a small orifice.
The amount of damping is determined by the viscosity of the fluid and the size
of the orifice. An aircraft nose wheel shimmy damper operates on the principle
of viscous damping. See shimmy damper.
vise. A bench-mounted clamp used to hold material while it is being worked on.
One jaw of the vise is fixed, and the other is mounted on a screw that allows it to
be moved away from or close to the fixed jaw.
Vise-grip pliers. A patented type of pliers in which the jaws can be locked
together by the over-center compound action of a toggle. A screw in one handle
of the pliers allows the basic size of the jaw opening to be adjusted, and when
the handles are squeezed together, the jaws lock tightly on the object between

them. Vise-grip pliers are made with many different types and shapes of jaws for
many different uses.
visibility. The ability, as determined by atmospheric conditions and expressed in
units of distance, to see and identify prominent unlighted objects by day, and
prominent lighted objects by night. Visibility is reported in statute miles,
hundreds of feet, or meters.
visibility (ICAO). The ability, as determined by atmospheric conditions and
expressed in units of distance, to see and identify prominent unlighted objects by
day and prominent lighted objects by night.
visible light. The very small range of electromagnetic radiation that produces
sensations the human eye and brain can accept. Vibrations making up visible
light have wavelengths of between approximately 4,000 and 7,700 angstroms.
One angstrom is equivalent to one billionth of a centimeter. The different
wavelengths of electromagnetic energy give light its color. Visible light with the
shortest wavelength has the color of violet, and that with the longest wavelength
has the color of red.
visual approach (air traffic control). An approach conducted on an instrument
flight rules (IFR) flight plan which authorizes the pilot to proceed visually and
clear of clouds to the airport. The pilot must, at all times, have either the airport
or the preceding aircraft in sight. This approach must be authorized and under
the control of the appropriate air traffic control facility, and the reported weather
at the airport must be: ceiling at or above 1,000 feet and visibility of three miles
or greater.
visual approach (ICAO). An approach by an IFR flight when either part or all of
an instrument approach procedure is not completed and the approach is executed
in visual reference to terrain.
visual approach slope indicator (VASI). The most common visual glidepath
system in use. The VASI provides obstruction clearance within 10° of the
extended runway centerline, and to 4 nautical miles (NM) from the runway
threshold.
visual climb over airport (VCOA). A departure option for an IFR aircraft,
operating in visual meteorological conditions equal to or greater than the
specified visibility and ceiling, to visually conduct climbing turns over the
airport to the published “climb-to” altitude from which to proceed with the

instrument portion of the departure. VCOA procedures are developed to avoid
obstacles greater than 3 statute miles from the departure end of the runway as an
alternative to complying with climb gradients greater than 200 feet per nautical
mile. These procedures are published in the “Take-Off Minimums and
(Obstacle) Departure Procedures” section of the Terminal Procedures
Publications. See AIM.
visual descent point (VDP). (1) A defined point on the final approach course of a
nonprecision straight-in approach procedure from which normal descent from
the MDA to the runway touchdown point may be commenced, provided the
runway environment is clearly visible to the pilot. (2) A defined point on the
final approach course of a nonprecision straight-in approach procedure from
which normal descent from the MDA to the runway touchdown point may be
commenced, provided the approach threshold of that runway, or approach lights,
or other markings identifiable with the approach end of that runway are clearly
visible to the pilot.
visual flight. A flight made by referencing the horizon and other outside
landmarks.
visual flight rules (VFR). Rules that govern the procedures for conducting flight
under visual conditions. The term “VFR” is also used in the United States to
indicate weather conditions that are equal to or greater than minimum VFR
requirements. In addition, it is used by pilots and controllers to indicate type of
flight plan.
visual holding (flight procedure). The holding of aircraft at selected, prominent
geographical fixes which can be easily recognized from the air.
visual line of sight (unmanned aircraft). A method of control and collision
avoidance that refers to the pilot or observer directly viewing the unmanned
aircraft with human eyesight. Corrective lenses (spectacles or contact lenses)
may be used by the pilot or visual observer. Aids to vision, such as binoculars,
field glasses, or telephoto television, may be employed as long as their field of
view (FOV) does not adversely affect the surveillance task.

who assists the small UA remote PIC and the person manipulating the controls
to see and avoid other air traffic, or objects aloft or on the ground.
visual references. Visual information the pilot derives from the observation of
real world cues looking out the flight deck window, used as a primary reference
for aircraft control or flight path assessment.
visual segment, on a published instrument approach procedure. A segment on an
instrument approach procedure (IAP) chart annotated as “Fly Visual to Airport”
or “Fly Visual.” A dashed arrow will indicate the visual flight path on the profile
and plan view with an associated note on the approximate heading and distance.
The visual segment should be flown as a dead reckoning course while
maintaining visual conditions.
visual separation (air traffic control). A means employed by ATC to separate
aircraft in terminal areas and en route airspace in the NAS. There are two ways
to effect this separation: (1) The tower controller sees the aircraft involved and

tube, in series with a resistor, is placed across the output of a DC power supply.
The gas in the tube ionizes when a specific voltage is placed across it, and when
the gas ionizes, electrons flow through it with very little opposition. The voltage
drop across the regulator tube remains constant as the load current changes.
voltage spike (electrical disturbance). A sudden, short-duration surge of high
voltage along a power line or in a piece of electrical equipment. Voltage spikes
are induced into the system by lightning or by some inductive equipment being
turned off. These high-voltage spikes can damage many types of semiconductor

devices. Surge protectors are used to bypass voltage spikes to ground, so they
cannot cause damage.
voltaic cell. See primary cell (electrochemical cell).
voltammeter (electrical measuring instrument). An instrument that can measure
both volts and amperes. A switch is built into the instrument to change its
function.
volt-amp. The basic unit of apparent power in an AC circuit. A volt-amp is the
product of the circuit voltage and all of the current, regardless of its phase. A
volt-amp differs from a watt in that a watt is a measure of true power and is the
product of the circuit voltage and only that current in phase with it.
voltmeter. An electrical measuring instrument used to measure electrical

instruments in series with a high resistance which limits the amount of current
that can flow through the meter. The deflection of the meter pointer is
proportional to the voltage across the meter and resistance combination.

is always less than 100%, but a supercharged engine can have a volumetric
efficiency greater than 100%.
VOM (electrical measuring instrument). A combination voltmeter,
milliammeter, and ohmmeter, all using a single indicating instrument. One
current-measuring instrument and a number of switches, resistors, and rectifiers
are used to measure a wide range of voltages, both AC and DC, current,
normally in milliamperes and microamperes, and resistance in ohms. A VOM
may have either an analog or digital display.

VOR (very-high-frequency omnirange navigation equipment). A type of
electronic navigation equipment in which the instrument in the cockpit identifies
the radial, or line from the VOR station measured in degrees clockwise from
magnetic north, along which the aircraft is located. VOR is a phase-comparison
system in which two signals transmitted simultaneously from a ground station
are in phase only when they are received at a location directly magnetic north of
the station. At a location magnetic east of the station, they are 90° out of phase.
At magnetic south, they are 180° out of phase, and west of the station, they are
270° out of phase.
The pilot selects on the omni bearing selector (OBS) the radial on which he
wants to fly, and the needle of the course deviation indicator (CDI) centers when
the aircraft is on the radial. If the aircraft moves off the radial, the needle moves
away from center to show the pilot which direction to turn to return the aircraft
to the radial. The indictor for the VOR is often also used as the localizer
indicator.

VOR minimum operational network (VOR MON). A minimum operational
network (MON) of VORs that provide basic conventional navigation service for
operators to use if the global navigational satellite system (GNSS) becomes
unavailable. During a GNSS disruption, the MON will enable aircraft to
navigate through the affected area, or to a safe landing at a MON airport that
does not rely on GNSS.
VOR test facility (VOT). A ground facility that emits a test signal to check VOR
receiver accuracy. Some VOTs are available to the user while airborne, and
others are limited to ground use only. Also referred to as “VOR test signal.”
VORTAC (electronic navigation system). An electronic navigation system used
by both military and civilian aircraft. The name VORTAC is the combination of
the names of two types of navigation equipment: VOR, very-high-frequency
omnirange navigation equipment, and TACAN, a military pulse-type tactical
navigation system. VOR and TACAN equipment are colocated at a VORTAC
station, and signals from both systems are transmitted simultaneously.
Military aircraft use the TACAN system for determining their direction and
distance from the VORTAC station. Civilian aircraft determine their direction
from the station by the VOR and their distance from the station by the distancemeasuring portion of TACAN. This distance is shown in the aircraft by the
distance measuring equipment (DME).
vortex. A whirling motion in a fluid. The Coriolis force caused by the rotation of
the earth causes water to flow out of a drain in a vortex. Air that spills over the

wing tips of an airplane spins in the form of vortices. A tornado is an extremely
strong vortex of air.
vortex dissipator (turbine powered aircraft component). A high-velocity stream
of compressor bleed air blown from a nozzle into an area where vortices are
likely to form. Vortex dissipators destroy the vortices that would otherwise suck
debris from the ground into engines mounted in pods below the wings.
vortex generators (aerodynamics). Small rectangular, low aspect ratio airfoils
mounted on the upper surface of the wings of some high-speed airplanes. Vortex
generators are mounted in pairs, and the air spilling over their upper ends forms
swirls, or vortices. These vortices pull high-energy air down to the surface of the
wing. Vortex generators prevent the air separating from the surface of the wing.
vortex ring state (helicopter flight condition). A transient condition of downward
flight (descending through air after just previously being accelerated downward
by the rotor) during which an appreciable portion of the main rotor system is
being forced to operate at angles of attack above maximum. Blade stall starts
near the hub and progresses outward as the rate of descent increases.

rises and descends vertically without requiring forward motion. A helicopter is
capable of VTOL operation.
VTVM (vacuum-tube voltmeter) (electrical measuring instrument). A voltmeter
that has a high input impedance so that it does not load the circuit whose voltage
is being measured. The voltage to be measured is impressed on the grid of a

with their center contacts rotated by the same shaft.
waffle piston (reciprocating engine component). A reciprocating engine piston
with fins cast or forged on the bottom of the head, inside the piston. The fins
cross to form a pattern that looks much like the surface of a waffle. The fins

of heat the oil can carry away from the piston.
wake. The high-velocity stream of turbulent air behind an operating aircraft
engine.
wake turbulence (aircraft operation). The disturbed air left behind an airplane. At
one time, it was thought that the rough air behind and below an airplane in flight
was caused by the propeller slipstream. But this turbulence is actually caused by

having a wall-like appearance and which form the outer boundary of the eye of a
well-developed tropical cyclone.
Wankel engine. A form of rotary, internal combustion engine. Instead of using
cylinders and moving pistons, the Wankel engine uses a rounded, triangularshaped rotor, with sliding seals that form the combustion space inside an oblong
circular chamber. Expanding gases from the burning fuel-air mixture press
against the rotor and rotate it and the drive shaft geared to it.

to cool. A warm wind is a movement of air whose temperature is slightly higher
than the temperature of the person upon whom it is blowing.
warm front (meteorology). The surface between two air masses in which a mass
of warm air is flowing over a mass of colder air. Warm fronts usually bring low
ceilings, fog, and light but steady rain.

ahead of the warm front is colder than the air of the cold front. See occluded
front (meteorology).
warm sector (meteorology). The area covered by warm air at the surface and
bounded by the warm front and cold front of a wave cyclone.

reach their normal operating temperature. Aircraft reciprocating engines must be
operated for a specified warm-up time before they are safe for takeoff.

participating in the activities being conducted in the area. Warning areas may
contain intensive military training, gunnery exercises, or special weapons
testing.
warning horn. An aural warning device that is used in conjunction with warning
lights to alert the flight crew of a dangerous condition. A continuous warning
horn alerts the pilot that the landing gear is not down and locked when either of
the throttles is retarded for landing. An intermittent warning horn sounds when

the thrust levers are advanced for takeoff if certain conditions exist that could
make takeoff dangerous.
warning lights. Indicator lights installed in the cockpit of an aircraft to warn the
flight crew of some unsafe condition. Overheat conditions, low fuel supply, low

indicated by warning lights.
warp. The threads in a piece of fabric that run the length of the fabric.
WARP. See weather and radar processing.
warpage. (1) Distortion caused by a nonuniform change of internal stresses. (2)
In composites, it is the result of distortion caused by shrinkage differences in a
reinforced molded part.
warp clock. An alignment indicator included in a structural repair manual to
show the orientation of the plies of a composite material. The ply direction is
shown in relation to a reference direction.

warp threads (fabric). Threads that run the length of a piece of fabric. Threads
that run across the fabric are called woof, or fill, threads.
warp tracers. Threads of a different color from the warp threads that are woven
into a material to identify the direction of the warp threads.
Warren truss. A type of structural truss in which the main lengthwise members
are separated by rigid diagonal members that carry both tensile and compressive
loads. Most welded-steel truss fuselages are Warren truss structures.
washer (type of hardware). A flat metal disk with a hole in its center used to
provide a smooth surface for a nut or the bolt head to seat against. Washers are

also used to shim, or fill a space, between a nut and a surface to take up space if
the grip length of the bolt is too long for the material being clamped.
wash-in (airplane rigging). A condition in airplane rigging in which a wing is
twisted so its angle of incidence is greater at the tip than at the root. Washing-in
a wing increases the lift to correct for a wing-heavy condition.
wash-out (airplane rigging). A condition in airplane rigging in which a wing is
twisted so its angle of incidence is less at the tip than at the root. Wash-out
decreases the lift the wing produces. If an airplane is left-wing-heavy, the left
wing can be washed in and the right wing washed out.
wash-out (helicopter rotor design). A design that decreases the blade angle from
root to tip by twisting it, which maintains the associated angle of attack or, in
many cases, reduces it. Wash-out controls the coefficient of lift from root to tip
to ensure even, or controlled, lift production throughout the length of the blade.
wash primer (aircraft finishing system component). A type of primer used to
prepare an aluminum or magnesium surface to receive a topcoat of finishing
material. Wash primer contains an etchant, a material that chemically roughens
the metal, to prepare the surface to accept the topcoat material.
waste gate (turbosupercharger component). A controllable butterfly valve in the
exhaust pipe of a reciprocating engine equipped with an exhaust-driven
turbocharger. When the waste gate is open, the exhaust gases leave the engine
through the exhaust pipe. But when it is closed, the gases must pass through the
turbine that drives the turbocharger compressor. By controlling the amount the
waste gate is open, the speed of the turbocharger can be controlled, and this
speed determines the manifold pressure in the engine.
water ballast (glider operation). A system of adding water to the wings or tail of
a glider to increase weight and optimize CG.
water break test (aircraft finishing). A test to determine that a metal surface is
entirely free of contamination and is ready to be painted. The area being tested is
covered with a thin film of distilled water. If any of the water beads up rather
than flowing out smoothly it indicates that the area has not been sufficiently
cleaned and the cleaning process must be repeated.
water equivalent (meteorology). The depth of water that would result from the
melting of snow or ice.

water injection (gas turbine engines). Pure water or a mixture of water and
alcohol is sprayed into the compressor inlet or the diffuser inlet. When the water
evaporates, it absorbs heat from the air and drops its temperature making the air
more dense. Increasing the density of the air flowing through the engine
increases the mass airflow, and this increases the thrust the engine produces.
water injection (reciprocating engines). A system in which a water and alcohol
mixture is injected into the induction system of a reciprocating engine when it is
developing full power. When the water injection system (or antidetonation
[ADI] system, as it is more properly called) is used, the fuel-air mixture being
produced by the carburetor is automatically leaned, or deriched, to allow the
engine to develop its maximum power.
The liquid water-alcohol mixture is injected with the fuel and air into the
cylinders where it turns into vapor. As it evaporates, it absorbs the heat that
would otherwise cause detonation.
waterline (reference line). A horizontal reference line used in lofting (laying out
the contour of an airplane fuselage). Waterline zero (WL 0) is used as the
reference, and measurements above this line are positive water lines.

rear end of each float that can be extended downward into the water to provide
more directional control when taxiing. They are attached by cables and springs
to the air rudder and operated by the rudder pedals in the cockpit.

A waveoff may be necessitated by a safety hazard in the landing area or by a
missed approach.
wave soldering. A method of soldering components to a printed circuit (PC)
board. All the components are assembled on the PC board, and the side of the
board on which the copper strips are formed is treated with flux. A tank of
molten solder is vibrated so waves form on the surface of the solder, and the
board is passed over the solder so the tip of the waves touch the fluxed copper
strips. All the component leads protruding through the board are soldered to the
copper strips.

system. A waypoint is located by keying in the radial from the VORTAC station
on which the waypoint is to be located, and the distance in nautical miles from
the station along the selected radial.
By using waypoints, rather than flying directly to the physical station, a flight
can be made in a straight line, and radio navigation can be used directly to a
destination having no radio facility. A waypoint may be defined relative to a
VORTAC station or in terms of latitude/longitude coordinates.

designed in such a way that a bending load is carried as a tensile load in one of
the caps and a compressive load in the other. The web between the two caps is
subjected to a shear load much lower than the tensile or the compressive load.
The web of a structural beam is usually thinner than either of the caps.

airship by taking weight off at launch.
weight. A measure of the force of gravity acting upon a body. Weight and mass
are often used interchangeably, but they are not the same thing. Mass is the
amount of material in a body and does not consider the effect of gravity acting
on it. Weight does take into consideration the effect of gravity acting on the
mass.
weight and balance record (aircraft record). The record kept in an aircraft that
gives the pilot or flight engineer an accurate account of the total weight of the
aircraft and the location of its center of gravity. If the aircraft weight is too great,
or if the center of gravity falls outside the allowable limits, the aircraft is not safe
to fly.
weight-shift control aircraft (WSC). A powered aircraft with a framed pivoting
wing and a fuselage controllable only in pitch and roll by the pilot’s ability to
change the aircraft’s center of gravity with respect to the wing. Flight control of

the aircraft depends on the wing’s ability to flexibly deform rather than on the
use of control surfaces.
weld bead. The ridge of metal left along the seam where two pieces of metal are
joined by welding. The ridge, caused by the metal from the welding rod,
increases the strength of the joint.
welded patch (steel tubular structural repair). A repair of dents or holes in steel
tubing by welding a patch of the same material, one gage thicker, over the
damaged area.
welding. A method of joining pieces of metal by fusion. The pieces to be joined
are placed next to each other, and the surfaces between the two pieces are melted
and allowed to flow together. The heat used to melt the edges is produced by a
gas flame, an electric arc, or an extremely hot stream of plasma (ionized particles
that act as a gas). Most welds are reinforced by adding filler metal to the puddle
of molten metal to build up the area where the pieces are joined.
welding flux. A material that melts and flows over the surface of metal being
welded. Flux produces an airtight seal which prevents oxygen reaching the
surface of the hot metal and forming an oxide film. Oxides on the metal
contaminate the weld.
Western Union splice (wire splice). A type of wire splice used to join two pieces
of solid copper wire. The insulation is removed from the ends of the two pieces

crossed and each end is wrapped around other wire; then the joint is coated with
molten solder and insulated with tape.
wet-bulb temperature. Temperature measured with a thermometer enclosed in a

the engine, is moved by scavenger pumps to the external tank where it is stored
until it is pumped through the engine again.
wet-type vacuum pump. An engine-driven air pump which uses steel vanes
lubricated with engine oil drawn into the pump through holes in the base. The oil
passes through the pump, where it seals and lubricates, and is then exhausted
with the air. Wet-type pumps must have oil separators in their discharge line to
trap the oil and return it to the engine crankcase.
wet wing (aircraft structure). A type of aircraft construction in which part of the
wing structure is sealed and used as a fuel tank. Wet wings are more properly
called integral fuel tanks.
Wheatstone bridge (electrical circuit). A four-arm electrical bridge circuit used
to measure resistance. An unknown resistance is placed in one arm of the bridge
and is compared with a variable, or known, resistance in an opposite arm. When
the variable resistor is adjusted until no current flows through the indicator, the
bridge is balanced and the unknown resistance is exactly the same as that of the
variable resistor.

wheel well (aircraft structural component). A part of an aircraft structure that
houses the landing gear when it is retracted. Wheel wells may be part of the
wing, engine nacelle, or fuselage.
“When able” (air traffic control). A phrase used in conjunction with ATC
instructions that gives the pilot latitude to delay compliance until a condition or
event has been reconciled. Unlike “pilot discretion,” when an instruction is
prefaced with “when able,” the pilot is expected to seek the first opportunity to
comply. Once a maneuver has been initiated, the pilot is expected to continue
until the specifications of the instructions have been met. “When able,” should
not be used when expeditious compliance is required.
whetstone. An abrasive stone used to wear away, or sharpen, the edges of cutting
tools.
whiffletree. A pivoted beam used in an aircraft control system to allow more
than one force to act on a common point. For example, two pulling forces may

2, 3, 4, 5, and so on.
wicking (soldering problem). A problem that occurs when solder flows up
around the individual wires in a stranded electrical conductor until it reaches the
insulation. When stranded wire is soldered, there should be a short piece of the
bare wire between the end of the solder and the beginning of the insulation. This
bare section allows the wire to flex smoothly so it will not break when it is
vibrated.

system (DGPS) that improves the accuracy of the system by determining
position error from the GPS satellites, then transmitting the error, or corrective
factors, to the airborne GPS receiver.

at specific altitudes, along with temperatures and air pressure can be viewed.
windmilling (aircraft engine operation). An aircraft engine is said to be
windmilling when it is turned by aerodynamic action of air flowing over the
propeller or through the compressor in a gas turbine engine. If an engine fails in
flight, air flowing over the propeller or through the compressor produces enough
force to keep the engine turning.

When a propeller windmills, it produces so much drag it can cause difficulty in
controlling the airplane. For this reason, the propellers of most multiengine
airplanes are made so that they can be feathered by turning the blades parallel to
the direction of flight. When a propeller is feathered, it does not windmill.
windmilling propeller. The continued rotation of a propeller after the engine is
shut down in flight. Aerodynamic forces act on the propeller to keep it turning,
or windmilling, with no power from the engine.

windows of an aircraft operating in the cold air at high altitudes. Warm
compressor bleed air is blown between the layers of transparent material of
which the windows are made.

right angles to the direction the wind is blowing. Wind shear, normally
associated with the passage of a front, can be dangerous if an aircraft flies
through one when slowed for landing or immediately after takeoff.
wind shear escape. An unplanned abortive maneuver initiated by the pilot-incommand (PIC) when an inadvertent wind shear encounter is experienced or an
onboard system issues a warning. Wind shear escapes are characterized by
maximum thrust climbs in the low altitude terminal environment until wind
shear conditions are no longer detected.
windshield. A transparent glass or plastic covering used to protect the occupants
of an aircraft from the wind and rain while allowing forward vision. A
windshield is also called a windscreen.
wind sock (wind direction indicator). A long, tapered, cloth tube open at both
ends. Its large end is supported and held open by a steel ring mounted in a
bearing so it is free to turn. Wind socks are mounted on tall poles so they can
catch the wind and stream out in the direction the wind is blowing. Wind socks
are normally made of vividly colored cloth and are used on airports and heliports
to show the pilot of an arriving aircraft the direction from which the wind is
blowing.

scale, one side represents the course and ground speed, one side the wind
direction and velocity, and the third side the heading and airspeed. Any value
can be found when the other five are known.
wind tunnel testing. A method of determining the aerodynamic characteristics of
an aircraft design. An accurate scale model of the aircraft is made and mounted
in the wind tunnel on a series of balances, or scales. Wind of an accurately
controlled speed is blown across the model, and the balances measure the
amount of lift and drag produced by the model at different wind speeds and
angles of attack.

the leading edge to the trailing edge.
wing fences. Vertical vanes that extend chordwise across the upper surface of an
airplane wing to prevent spanwise airflow.
wing fillet (aircraft structural component). A streamlined fairing installed
between the root of an airplane wing and the fuselage. Wing fillets smooth the
airflow where the wing joins the fuselage and reduce the drag caused by this
junction.
wing flaps (airplane secondary controls). An auxiliary control on an airplane that
can be lowered to increase both the lift and drag the wing produces. Wing flaps
are partially lowered for takeoff to allow the airplane to leave the ground at a
slow speed. They are fully lowered for landing to allow the airplane to make a

steep approach without building up excessive speed. See plain flap, split flap,
slotted flap, Fowler flap, triple-slotted flap.
wing floats (or, tip floats). See wing-tip floats. See also sponsons.
wing heavy (flight condition). An out-of-trim condition in which an airplane

corrected by changing the rigging of the wing or by the deflection of one of the
trim tabs.
winglet (aerodynamic surface). A vertical or angled extension at the wingtip of
many transport and corporate airplanes. Winglets improve the efficiency of an
aircraft by decreasing wingtip vortices which cause lift-induced drag. Winglets
increase the effective aspect ratio of a wing without adding to the span.
winglet (tip fin). 14 CFR Part 1: “An out-of-plane surface extending from a
lifting surface. The surface may or may not have control surfaces.”

foot of airplane wing area must support. Wing loading is found by dividing the
maximum weight of the aircraft, in pounds, by the total area of the wing, in
square feet.

sides. The wings allow the nut to be turned onto a bolt using only the fingers. No
provision is made for turning a wing nut with a wrench.
wing panel (airplane structural component). A removable section of an airplane
wing. Most airplane wings are made in panels, with a left and a right panel
attached to a center section. The center section is often a part of the fuselage.
wing rib (aircraft component). The structural member in an aircraft wing that
gives the wing its aerodynamically correct cross-sectional shape. Wing ribs are
mounted across the wing spars and are covered with thin sheets of metal,
plywood, or cloth fabric.
wing span (aircraft wing dimension). The length of an aircraft wing, or the
distance from one wing tip to the other.
WINGS Program. A program that encourages general aviation pilots to continue
training and provides an opportunity to practice selected maneuvers in a
minimum of instruction time. Participation in the WINGS program relieves a

pilot from compliance with flight review requirements, provided all WINGS
requirements are met. Previously governed by Advisory Circular 61-91, the
WINGS program is available as on online education program at
www.faasafety.gov, effective mid-2007.
wing strut (airplane component). The external rigid braces that extend from the
bottom of the fuselage, for a high wing airplane, to the wing spars at a point
about midway of the span of the wing panel. The strut carries the flight loads in
tension and the landing loads in compression. Thin struts are normally fitted
with jury struts to prevent vibration and buckling. See jury strut.
wing-tip floats (seaplane component). A buoyant body of streamline shape
attached to the wing tips of a flying-boat or single-float seaplane to prevent the
wing tips from contacting the water.
wing-tip vortices (aircraft operation). Tornado-like disturbances produced at the
wing tips any time an airplane wing is producing lift. When a wing produces lift,
the air pressure on top of the wing is much lower than the pressure below the
wing, and the high-pressure air below the wing spills over to the top at the tip,
producing a tight spiral, or vortex, of wind. Wing-tip vortices settle below the
airplane, and those produced by heavy airplanes can cause lighter aircraft flying
into them to be thrown out of control.
wing twist. A design feature in which a wing panel has a built-in wash-out twist.
This twist decreases the angle of incidence near the wing tip and maintains
aileron effectiveness by delaying the stall to a higher angle of attack. See wash
out.
wink Zyglo. See blink Zyglo.
wiper (electrical component). The movable contact in a potentiometer, rheostat,
or wafer-type switch. The wiper is controlled by rotating the shaft that extends
through the center of the device, and as the wiper is rotated, it makes contact
with a part of the resistance element or with one of the fixed contacts of the
switch.

routed through a compartment of the aircraft. The wires are grouped together
and secured with nylon straps or lacing cord into a compact bundle, and the
bundle is secured to the aircraft structure with cushioned clamps.

for identification, of all the electrical appliances and devices used on aircraft.
W/M injection (turbine engine thrust augmentation). A system in which a
mixture of water and methanol (methyl alcohol) is injected into the compressor
inlet and/or the combustion chamber of a turbine engine. The W/M injection
increases the thrust by increasing the mass of the air flowing through the engine.
It also cools the gases flowing through the turbine so more fuel can be burned
before reaching the limiting turbine inlet temperature. W/M injection is not used
on modern turbine engines.
wobble pump (fluid pump). A type of hand-operated pump used to move a fluid
such as gasoline or oil. The handle of a wobble pump is attached to a flat plate
inside a housing that is equipped with four flapper-type check valves. Moving
the handle back and forth (wobbling it) pulls fluid into one side of the pump and
forces it out the other side.
Wood’s metal. The registered trade name for an alloy of bismuth, lead, tin, and
cadmium. Wood’s metal melts at 158°F.

woodruff key. A hardened steel key made in the shape of a half circle. The
rounded side of the key fits into a semicircular keyway cut into a shaft. The flat

difficult. Please say every phrase twice.” As information: “Since
communications are difficult, every phrase in this message will be spoken
twice.”
word/symbol confusion (in teaching/learning process). In explaining concepts or
conversing with students, a miscommunication that can occur when the
distinction between a word and its connotation (or what it symbolizes) is not
made clear by the instructor. Effective communication is easier when speakers
and writers are aware of the distinctions of meaning in words they use.
Instructors should be careful that their words bring to mind the correct symbols
for their students when trying to communicate aviation concepts. See also
symbols.
work. The physical measurement of the amount of force required to produce a

roads, railroads, distinctive landmarks, drainage, and relief; aeronautical
information included visual and radio aids to navigation, airports, airways, and
more. Publication of these charts was discontinued in 2015.
worm gear. A helical gear mounted on a shaft and meshed with a spur gear
whose teeth are cut at an angle to its face. A worm gear is an irreversible type of

appearance of a crease or fold in one or more outer laminations. It also occurs in
vacuum bag molding when the bag is improperly placed, causing a crease.
wrinkle finish. A rough paint finish that is often applied to aircraft instrument
panels. The surface of wrinkle-finish paint dries quickly, and the material below
the surface shrinks as it dries. The shrinkage pulls the surface into a series of
small wrinkles. A wrinkle finish does not show fingerprints or small scratches as
much as a smooth finish.

is Xe, its atomic number is 54, and its atomic weight is 131.30. Xenon is
extracted from liquified air, and it is used to fill stroboscopic lamps because it
gives off a brilliant flash of light when it is ionized and current flows through it.
X-ray inspection. A form of nondestructive inspection in which a piece of
photographic film is exposed by X-rays passing through a section of the aircraft
structure. The density of the structure determines the amount of energy passed to
the film. Because of the different densities of the structure, an image of the
structure is formed on the film. X-ray inspection is used to examine the inside of
a structure for corrosion or damage that deforms the structure.
X-rays. Rays of electromagnetic energy having a wavelength of approximately
one angstrom. X-rays are produced by accelerating electrons to a high velocity
and then stopping them instantly by collision with a solid object. X-rays are able
to penetrate many types of solid objects and are used to produce a photographic

yardstick is marked at every inch along its length.
yaw (aircraft flight condition). A flight condition of an aircraft in which the
aircraft rotates about its vertical axis. Yawing is not the same as turning, because
an aircraft can be yawed and continue in straight flight with the wind striking it
from the side. When an airplane is turned, it follows a curved flight path, with
the wind always flowing parallel to its longitudinal axis.
yaw damper (airplane control). A part of an aircraft automatic flight control
system used to keep the aircraft from unwanted yawing. Yaw dampers are
generally needed for swept-wing airplanes because of the tendency of this type
of airplane to Dutch roll. See Dutch roll.
yaw string (yaw indicator). A piece of string or yarn approximately 18 to 36
inches in length, taped to the base of the windshield, or to the nose near the
windshield, along the airplane centerline. In two-engine coordinated flight, the
relative wind will cause the string to align itself with the longitudinal axis of the
airplane, and it will position itself straight up the center of the windshield. This
is zero sideslip. Experimentation with slips and skids will vividly display the
location of the relative wind.

Y-axis. The lateral, or pitch, axis of an aircraft. The vertical, or yaw, axis is the
Z-axis, and the longitudinal, or roll, axis is the X-axis. See lateral axis.

windings is 120 electrical degrees out of phase with the current flowing in the
other windings.
The voltage across the ends of the two windings is 1.73 times the voltage
across either of the windings and the common point. A Y-connected circuit is
sometimes called a wye-connected circuit or a star-connected circuit.

U.S. or first foreign airworthiness certificate.
yellow arc (aircraft instrument marking). A type of range marking for aircraft
instruments that identifies a caution area. A yellow arc on the dial of an airspeed
indicator identifies a range of airspeeds that can be safely flown in calm air, but
the aircraft must not be flown at these speeds in rough air. There must be no
abrupt maneuvers made while flying in this speed range.
yield point (material strength). A measure of the amount of stress needed to
permanently deform a material. When a piece of material is stressed to a value
within its elastic limit, it will deform, but will return to its original size and
shape when the stress is removed. When the material is stressed to its yield
point, it will not return to its original size and shape when the stress is removed;
it will be permanently deformed.
yield strength. The amount of stress needed to permanently deform a material.

reciprocating engine. One branch of the Y goes to the oil tank, the other to the
inlet of the oil pressure pump. The lower branch contains a valve from which the
oil is drained.

Zahn cup (viscosity measuring instrument). A specially designed viscosimeter,
or cup for measuring the viscosity of a liquid. The Zahn cup is filled with the
liquid whose viscosity is to be measured. A specially calibrated hole in the
bottom of the cup is opened, and the time needed for the liquid to flow from the
cup is measured. The number of seconds between the start of the flow and the
time at which the first break in the flow occurs relates to the viscosity of the
liquid.
Z-axis. The vertical, or yaw, axis of an aircraft. The X-axis is the longitudinal, or
roll axis, and the Y-axis is the lateral, or pitch axis. See vertical axis.
zener diode (electronic component). A special type of semiconductor device that
allows electrons to flow through it in one direction, but normally opposes flow in
the opposite direction. If the voltage across the zener diode, in the direction that
does not allow flow, is increased to a specific value, the zener diode will break
down, and electrons will flow through it. The voltage at which a zener diode
breaks down is called the zener voltage. Zener diodes are also called avalanche
diodes.

body, at which the orbiting body is the greatest distance from the object around
which it is rotating. The zenith of an orbit is opposite the nadir of the orbit.
zephyr (meteorology). A mild breeze, usually one blowing from the west.

Zeppelin. A large, rigid, lighter-than-air flying machine. The Zeppelin gets its
name from Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin who pioneered the design and
manufacture of these large, cigar-shaped airships. Zeppelins were used in World
War I, and to a limited extent in commercial air travel, until the time the huge
German airship Hindenburg burned in 1939.
Zerk fitting (grease fitting). The registered trade name for a type of fitting used
to put grease into a bearing. A hole is drilled through the structure to the location
where grease is needed, and a Zerk fitting is installed in this hole.
The Zerk fitting has a ball-shaped top that is gripped by the nozzle of the
grease gun when pressure is applied. Grease is pumped through the fitting into
the bearing until it flows out between the surfaces of the bearing. When the
grease gun is removed from the Zerk fitting, a check valve inside the fitting
prevents grease leaking out, and prevents dirt getting into the bearing through
the fitting.
zero (mathematical quantity). A numerical quantity that has no value. Zero is
used as a reference point on a number line from which values on both sides of
zero are measured.
zero (temperature). A reference used in the measurement of temperature. In the
measurement of absolute temperatures using both degrees Kelvin and degrees
Rankine, zero is the point at which all molecular movement stops. In the
measure of temperature using the Celsius scale (the centigrade scale), zero is the
temperature of melting ice. In the measure of temperature using the Fahrenheit
scale, zero is the temperature of a mixture of ice and salt water.
zero adjustment (electrical measuring instrument). The adjustment of the pointer
of an electrical measuring instrument so that the needle rests over the zero mark
on the dial when no current is flowing through the moving coil of the meter.
zero beat (frequency adjustment). A method of determining the exact frequency
of an alternating current. Vibrations caused by a variable-frequency alternating
current are mixed with vibrations caused by the alternating current whose
frequency is to be found. When the two vibrations mix, a third vibration is
formed whose frequency is the difference between the frequencies of the first
two vibrations. The variable frequency is changed until the third vibration
disappears. At this point, the two frequencies are exactly the same. The beat has
been reduced to zero.

zero bleed (composites). A laminate fabrication procedure that does not allow
loss of resin during cure. Also describes prepreg made with the amount of resin
desired in the final part, such that no resin has to be removed during cure.

by the force of inertia. Zero gravity is felt in a high-performance aircraft when it
is flying in a parabolic, or curved, flight path, and in a satellite when it is
orbiting the earth.
zero-lash valve lifter (reciprocating engine component). A type of valve lifter in
a reciprocating engine that uses a hydraulic device to keep all clearance out of
the valve train. Each time an intake or exhaust valve is opened, a specific
amount of oil leaks from the hydraulic valve lifter, and while the valve is closed,
engine oil pressure refills the lifter so it keeps all of the operating clearance out
of the valve mechanism.
zero-lift line (aerodynamics). An imaginary line through an airfoil along which
air can flow over both sides of the surface of the airfoil and not produce any lift.
The zero-lift line is the chord line of a symmetrical airfoil, but it is at a negative
angle of attack for an asymmetrical airfoil.
zero sideslip (flight condition). A maneuver in a twin-engine airplane with one
engine inoperative that involves a small amount of bank and slightly
uncoordinated flight to align the fuselage with the direction of travel and
minimize drag.

zero stage (turbine engine). A stage of compressor blades installed ahead of the
front of an axial compressor.
zero thrust. An engine configuration with a low power setting that simulates a
propeller feathered condition.
zinc. A bluish-white, lustrous, metallic chemical element. Zinc’s symbol is Z, its
atomic number is 30, and its atomic weight is 65.37. Zinc is used as an alloying
agent for other metals and as a corrosion-resistant coating for steel.
zinc chromate primer. An alkyd resin primer used to prepare a metal surface to
take a topcoat of paint. Moisture in contact with a coating of zinc chromate
primer causes the primer to release chromate ions that inhibit the formation of
corrosion on the metal protected by the primer.
zirconium. A lustrous, grayish-white, metallic chemical element. Zirconium’s
symbol is Zr, its atomic number is 40, and its atomic weight is 91.22. Zirconium
is used as an ingredient in ceramics and refractory materials.
Z-marker (aerial navigation). A type of directional radio beacon used to mark a
specific location along an airway or along an instrument approach course. A Zmarker transmits a vertical signal on a 75-megahertz carrier modulated with a
series of 3,000 hertz dots. The series of dots can be heard over the radio speaker,
and the Z-marker also causes the white light on the marker beacon panel to light
up in a series of short flashes, the dots.
zonal wind (meteorology). A west wind or the westerly component of a wind.
Zonal wind is conventionally used to describe large-scale flow that is neither
cyclonic nor anticyclonic.
zone of confusion. Volume of space above a VOR station where a lack of
adequate navigation signal directly above the station causes the needle to
deviate.
zone numbers (aircraft drawing). Numbers placed along the edges of large
aircraft drawings to identify the location of a part on the drawing. Numerals are
used along the length of the drawing, and letters are used along the width.
Zulu time. A name for Greenwich mean time, or universal time. See universal
time.

Zyglo inspection (nondestructive inspection). The registered trade name for a
type of nondestructive inspection used to find flaws that extend to the surface of
a metallic or nonmetallic material. The part to be inspected is cleaned and
soaked in a bath of hot penetrating liquid that contains a fluorescent dye. After
the part has soaked for the correct length of time, it is removed from the bath,
and all of the penetrant is washed from its surface. The part is then covered with
a dry powder that pulls the penetrant from any surface defect. The part is then
examined under an ultraviolet light, and any penetrant that has been pulled from
a defect shows up as a green mark.
